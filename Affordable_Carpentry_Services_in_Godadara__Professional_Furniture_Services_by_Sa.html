<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat &amp; Godadara</h2>

   Cracks and splits:  Sudden temperature changes can cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks.
   Loose joints and broken components:  Years of use can take their toll on even the sturdiest pieces.
   Outdated styles: That beloved but outdated sofa could benefit from a professional upgrade.</p>
<p>These issues can lead to costly repairs or even complete replacement, which is why preventative maintenance and timely repairs are crucial. Neglecting these issues can also pose safety risks, especially with damaged chairs or tables.</p>
