<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat: The Impact of Climate</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperatures, poses significant risks to your furniture.  High humidity during the monsoon season can lead to wood warping, mold growth, and fabric damage.  Conversely, the intense summer heat can cause fading, cracking, and drying of wooden furniture and upholstery.  Neglecting these issues can lead to costly repairs or even complete replacement. Ignoring these problems can also create safety hazards, such as weakened structures that could pose a risk.</p>
