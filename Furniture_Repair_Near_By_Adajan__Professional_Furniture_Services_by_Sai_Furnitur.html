<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate presents unique challenges for your furniture.  The intense heat and humidity can lead to:</p>
<p>Wood warping and cracking:  Changes in temperature and moisture content can cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks and warping.
   Upholstery damage:  Mold and mildew can thrive in humid conditions, damaging fabric and causing unpleasant odors.
   Pest infestations:  Warm temperatures can attract wood-boring insects, leading to extensive damage.
   Loose joints and structural issues:  Years of wear and tear, especially on heavily used pieces, can cause joints to loosen and structural problems to arise.</p>
