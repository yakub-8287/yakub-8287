<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>The hot and humid climate of Surat, Gujarat, can take a toll on your furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  Excessive moisture can cause wood to rot, swell, and warp, compromising the structural integrity of chairs, tables, and other pieces.
   Pest infestation:  Termites and other wood-boring insects thrive in humid conditions, leading to extensive damage and costly repairs.
   Cracked or broken joints:  Normal wear and tear, coupled with climate fluctuations, can lead to cracked or broken joints in furniture, making it unstable and unsafe.
   Outdated or damaged finishes:  Over time, furniture finishes can become chipped, scratched, or faded, diminishing their aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>These problems not only impact the appearance of your furniture but can also pose safety risks, potentially leading to injuries. Repairing these issues promptly is crucial to prevent further damage and ensure the safety of your family.</p>
