<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate presents unique challenges for furniture.  Common issues we encounter include:</p>

   Insect infestation:  Certain insects thrive in humid conditions, leading to infestations that damage wood and upholstery.
   Upholstery damage:  Spills, tears, and general wear and tear are common, especially in high-traffic areas.
