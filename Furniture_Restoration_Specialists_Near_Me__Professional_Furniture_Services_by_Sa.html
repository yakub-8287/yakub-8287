<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat: The Challenges of Heat and Humidity</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, characterized by high humidity and temperature fluctuations, poses significant challenges to furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  Excessive moisture can cause wood to swell, crack, and rot, particularly in older, untreated furniture.
   Insect infestation:  Warm, humid conditions create an ideal breeding ground for wood-boring insects, damaging the structure and finish of your furniture.
   Fading and discoloration:  Sunlight and humidity can cause furniture finishes to fade and become dull over time.
   Upholstery damage:  Wear and tear, spills, and humidity can affect upholstery fabrics.</p>
<p>Ignoring these issues can lead to costly repairs down the line and even potential safety hazards.</p>
