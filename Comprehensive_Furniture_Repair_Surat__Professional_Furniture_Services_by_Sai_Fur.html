<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat:  The Challenges of Gujarat's Climate</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperature, presents unique challenges for furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  The high humidity can cause wood to swell, crack, and even rot.
 Mildew and mold: Dampness encourages the growth of harmful fungi, damaging both the wood and upholstery.
 Insect infestations:  Certain insects thrive in warm, humid environments, causing significant damage to wooden furniture.
 Upholstery wear and tear:  Regular use, along with humidity, can lead to fabric fading, tearing, and general deterioration.</p>
<p>These problems not only affect the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but also pose potential safety hazards. Ignoring these issues can lead to expensive replacements, rather than a simple and cost-effective repair.</p>
