<h2>2. Problem Statement: Common Furniture Issues in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can significantly impact furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and decay:  High humidity weakens wood, leading to warping, cracking, and even infestation.
 Loose joints and structural damage:  Over time, furniture weakens, resulting in loose joints and instability.
 Damaged upholstery and finishes:  Wear and tear, along with harsh weather conditions, can affect the appearance of furniture.
 Pest infestations:  Warm, humid conditions can attract termites and other wood-boring insects.</p>
<p>These issues not only detract from the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but can also pose safety hazards and lead to costly replacements.  Repairing or restoring furniture professionally is a more economical and sustainable solution compared to buying new pieces.</p>
