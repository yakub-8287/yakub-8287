The intense heat can cause wood to dry out and crack, while the humidity promotes the growth of mold and mildew.  These issues not only affect the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but can also significantly reduce its structural integrity. Scratches, water damage, and fading are common problems, leading to costly repairs or even complete replacements. Ignoring these issues can lead to further damage and potentially hazardous situations, especially with older, potentially unstable furniture.</p>
