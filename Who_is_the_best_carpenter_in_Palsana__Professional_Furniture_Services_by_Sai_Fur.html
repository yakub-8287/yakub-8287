<h2>The Problem with Damaged Furniture in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat, with its vibrant climate, presents unique challenges for furniture. The humidity and fluctuating temperatures can lead to warping, cracking, and insect damage.  Whether it's a beloved antique chair or a modern dining table, these issues aren't just cosmetic; they can compromise the structural integrity and safety of your furniture.  Ignoring these problems often leads to costly replacements, and improperly handled repairs can make matters worse. Furthermore, attempting DIY fixes can lead to accidents or further damage.</p>
<p>Common issues:  Wood rot, termite infestation, broken joints, upholstery damage, scratches, and water damage.
