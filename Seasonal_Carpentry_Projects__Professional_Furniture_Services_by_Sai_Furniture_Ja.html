<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat: Understanding the Challenges</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperatures, puts significant stress on wooden furniture.  Common issues we encounter include:</p>
<p>Wood warping and cracking:  Due to fluctuating humidity.
   Loose joints and weakened structures: Caused by expansion and contraction of wood.
   Pest infestation:  A problem exacerbated by the warm, humid climate.
   Faded finishes:  Sun exposure and humidity can dull the vibrancy of wood finishes.</p>
<p>These problems not only affect the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but can also compromise its structural integrity, leading to safety concerns and costly replacements.</p>
