<h2>Common Patio Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate presents unique challenges for outdoor furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Sun-damaged wood: Fading, cracking, and splintering due to prolonged sun exposure.

   Torn or faded cushions: Wear and tear from regular use and exposure to the elements.
   Loose joints and wobbly legs:  General wear and tear from use.</p>
<p>Ignoring these issues can lead to costly replacements and even safety hazards.  For example, a wobbly chair can lead to injury, while rotting wood might pose a risk to children playing nearby.</p>
