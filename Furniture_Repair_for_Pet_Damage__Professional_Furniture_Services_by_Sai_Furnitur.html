<h2>2. The Problem:  Pet Damage &amp; Surat's Unique Challenges</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperature, can exacerbate existing furniture damage.  Pet-related wear and tear, coupled with these environmental factors, can quickly lead to significant issues.  Consider these common problems:</p>
<p>Scratches and gouges: From playful claws on sofas to accidental bumps on wooden tables.
   Tears and rips:  Fabric upholstery can suffer from enthusiastic pets.
   Urine stains and odors:  These require specialized cleaning and repair techniques.
   Water damage:  Accidents happen, and water can weaken wood and damage fabric.</p>
