<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can significantly impact your furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood warping and cracking:  The heat and humidity can cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks and warping, particularly in older pieces.
   Pest infestation:  Warm, humid conditions can attract wood-boring insects, damaging the structure of your furniture.
   Loose joints and broken parts:  Daily use can weaken joints and lead to breakage, requiring repair or replacement.
   Damaged finishes:  Sunlight and daily use can fade or damage the finish on your furniture, diminishing its aesthetic appeal.  These problems can become costly to repair if left unattended, posing both financial and safety concerns.</p>
