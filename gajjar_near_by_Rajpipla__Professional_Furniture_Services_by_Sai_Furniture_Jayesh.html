<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat &amp; Rajpipla</h2>
<p>The humid climate of Surat and surrounding areas like Rajpipla can wreak havoc on your furniture.  Wood can warp, crack, and become infested with pests.  Traditional furniture, so cherished in Gujarat, is particularly vulnerable.  These issues not only diminish the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but also pose safety risks.  Ignoring these problems can lead to costly repairs down the line.  </p>
<p>Wood rot and decay:  Humidity encourages fungal growth, leading to structural weakening.
 Pest infestations:  Termites and woodworms can cause significant damage.
 Cracks and splits:  Changes in temperature and humidity cause wood to expand and contract.
 Loose joints and broken parts:  Years of wear and tear take their toll.</p>
<p>Ignoring these problems can lead to costly replacements and safety hazards.</p>
