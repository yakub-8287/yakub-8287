                <h1>What are affordable carpentry services near Majura | Professional Furniture Services by Sai Furniture (Jayeshbhai)</h1>

<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, significantly impacts furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  The humid climate can cause wood to expand and contract, leading to warping, cracking, and even rot.
 Pest infestations:  Termites and other insects are prevalent, causing significant damage to wooden furniture.
 Sun damage:  Direct sunlight can fade and crack furniture finishes.
 General wear and tear: Daily use inevitably leads to scratches, dents, and loose joints.</p>
<p>These issues not only diminish the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but can also compromise its structural integrity, potentially leading to safety hazards and costly replacements.  Investing in timely repairs is far more economical than purchasing entirely new pieces.</p>
