<p>Wood rot and damage:  The humid climate can cause wood to warp, rot, and become structurally unsound, posing safety risks and potentially violating building codes.
   Pest infestations:  Warm, humid conditions create ideal breeding grounds for termites and other wood-boring insects, leading to extensive damage and costly repairs.
   Deterioration of finishes:  High humidity can cause paint and varnish to peel, requiring costly refinishing to maintain aesthetic appeal and structural integrity.
   Structural instability:  Damaged or compromised furniture can create safety hazards and potentially lead to non-compliance with building regulations.</p>
