<h2>2. Common Furniture Problems in Surat: Why You Need Professional Help</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, can severely damage wooden furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and decay:  Humidity encourages the growth of fungi and bacteria, weakening the wood structure.
   Cracks and splits: Temperature changes cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks.
   Scratches and dents: Daily wear and tear leave their mark on your furniture.
   Loose joints and broken pieces:  Over time, joints can loosen, and pieces can break off.</p>
<p>Ignoring these issues can lead to costly replacements and even safety hazards.  A seemingly minor crack can quickly worsen, leading to structural instability.</p>
