<h2>The Challenges of Furniture in Surat's Climate</h2>
<p>Surat, with its hot summers and humid monsoons, presents unique challenges for furniture.  The fluctuating temperature and humidity can cause wood to warp, crack, or become infested with pests.

Repairing damaged furniture is often costly, but neglecting the issue can be even more expensive in the long run.  And, attempting DIY repairs can sometimes worsen the problem, increasing both the cost and the risk of injury.</p>
