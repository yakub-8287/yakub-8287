<h2>Common Rattan Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can take a toll on rattan furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Weakened or broken rattan:  The constant humidity can cause the rattan to become brittle and break easily.
 Loose joints:  Changes in temperature and humidity can loosen the joints, leading to instability.
 Fading and discoloration:  Exposure to sunlight can cause the rattan to fade and lose its vibrancy.
 Pest infestation:  Warm, humid conditions can attract pests that damage the rattan.
 General wear and tear:  Daily use inevitably leads to wear and tear, requiring professional attention.</p>
<p>These problems not only affect the aesthetics of your furniture but can also pose safety risks, especially if the furniture becomes unstable.  Ignoring these issues can lead to more costly repairs in the long run.</p>
