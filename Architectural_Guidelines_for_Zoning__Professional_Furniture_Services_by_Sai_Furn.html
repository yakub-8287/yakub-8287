Ignoring these issues can lead to costly repairs down the line and even safety hazards.  The cost of replacing damaged furniture can be significant, especially considering the exquisite craftsmanship found in traditional Gujarati furniture.  For example, a damaged antique wooden chair might require extensive restoration, impacting both the budget and the project timeline.</p>
