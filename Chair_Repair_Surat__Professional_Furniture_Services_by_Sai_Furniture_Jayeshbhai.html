<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat: The Challenges of Gujarat's Climate</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can wreak havoc on your furniture.  Common issues we encounter include:</p>

 Fabric damage:  Moisture and mildew can stain and weaken upholstery fabrics.
 Loose joints and broken legs:  Regular wear and tear, exacerbated by humidity, can loosen joints and break chair legs.
 Pest infestations:  Warm, humid conditions can attract pests that damage wood and upholstery.</p>
