<h2>2. Problem Statement: Common Furniture Challenges in Surat's Hospitality Sector</h2>
<p>Maintaining the pristine condition of furniture in Surat's bustling hospitality scene presents unique challenges. The city’s tropical climate, characterized by high humidity and temperature fluctuations, can severely impact furniture longevity.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  Humidity causes wood to swell, crack, and eventually rot, especially in older furniture.
   Fabric damage:  Moisture and mildew can stain and degrade upholstery, impacting its aesthetic appeal and hygiene.
   Pest infestations:  Warm, humid conditions can attract pests like termites and silverfish, causing significant damage.
   Wear and tear:  High foot traffic in hotels and restaurants leads to quick deterioration, necessitating frequent repairs.</p>
<p>These issues not only impact the visual appeal of your establishment but also incur significant repair and replacement costs, potentially affecting your bottom line. Safety concerns also arise from damaged furniture, potentially leading to accidents and liability issues.</p>
