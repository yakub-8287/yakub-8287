<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can wreak havoc on your furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  Excess moisture can cause wood to expand, leading to warping and cracking.
 Pest infestation:  High humidity creates ideal conditions for termites and other wood-boring insects.
 Fading and discoloration:  Sun exposure and humidity can cause your furniture to fade and lose its vibrancy.
 Loose joints and broken components:  Years of use can take a toll, leading to structural issues.</p>
<p>These problems not only affect the aesthetics of your furniture but can also pose safety risks. Ignoring these issues can lead to more expensive repairs down the line, potentially requiring full furniture replacement.</p>
