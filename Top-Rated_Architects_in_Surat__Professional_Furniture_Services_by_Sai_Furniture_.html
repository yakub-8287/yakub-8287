<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>The hot, humid climate of Surat presents unique challenges for furniture.  From the warping of wooden pieces due to humidity to the fading of fabrics in the intense sunlight, maintaining the quality of your furnishings can be a constant struggle.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and insect infestation:  The humidity fosters the growth of mold and attracts pests, damaging the structural integrity of your furniture.
 Fabric fading and wear:  The strong sunlight and heat can quickly fade upholstery and damage delicate fabrics.
 Cracks and splits in wood:  Temperature fluctuations cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks and splits.
 Loose joints and broken components:  Years of use and exposure to the elements weaken furniture, making it unstable and potentially unsafe.</p>
