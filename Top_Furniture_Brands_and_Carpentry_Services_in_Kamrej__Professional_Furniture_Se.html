<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>The hot and humid Surat climate presents unique challenges for your furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  Excess moisture can cause wood to expand, crack, and rot, especially in older furniture pieces.
   Pest infestation:  Warm, humid conditions can attract insects like termites and borers, damaging wooden furniture.
   Fading and discoloration:  Sunlight and humidity can cause fabrics and finishes to fade and lose their vibrancy.
   Structural damage:  Over time, furniture can suffer from wear and tear, resulting in loose joints, broken legs, or damaged upholstery.</p>
