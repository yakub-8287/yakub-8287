<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperatures, can take a toll on your furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  High humidity can cause wood to absorb moisture, leading to rot and warping, particularly in older furniture.
 Cracked and damaged surfaces:  Temperature fluctuations can cause wood to expand and contract, resulting in cracks and damage.
 Pest infestation:  Certain insects thrive in humid conditions, damaging wooden furniture.
 Loose joints and broken components:  Years of use and wear can cause furniture joints to loosen and components to break.</p>
<p>These issues not only affect the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but also pose safety concerns, and often result in costly replacements.</p>
