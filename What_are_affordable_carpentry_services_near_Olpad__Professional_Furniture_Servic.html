<h2>The Challenges of Maintaining Furniture in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, can significantly impact your furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood warping and cracking:  The fluctuating humidity can cause wood to expand and contract, leading to warping, cracks, and structural damage.
 Pest infestations:  Warm, humid conditions create a breeding ground for wood-boring insects, damaging furniture beyond repair if left untreated.
 Fading and discoloration:  Prolonged sun exposure can fade the finish and discolor your furniture, reducing its aesthetic appeal.
 General wear and tear: Daily use inevitably causes wear and tear, requiring repairs and maintenance.</p>
