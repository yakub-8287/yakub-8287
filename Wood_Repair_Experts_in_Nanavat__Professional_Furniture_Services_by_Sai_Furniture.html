<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat: The Challenges We Address</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperatures, can significantly impact wooden furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Cracks and Splits:  Dry conditions can cause wood to shrink and crack.

   Scratches and Dents:  Daily wear and tear can leave marks on your treasured pieces.
   Loose Joints and Dowels:  Over time, these can become unstable, affecting furniture's functionality and safety.
   Pest Infestations:  Woodworm and other pests can cause significant damage if left untreated.</p>
<p>These issues not only affect the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but also pose safety risks, especially if structural integrity is compromised.  Ignoring these problems can lead to costly replacements down the line.</p>
