<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's climate presents unique challenges to furniture.  High humidity can lead to wood warping, swelling, and mildew, while fluctuating temperatures cause expansion and contraction, stressing joints and finishes.

Ignoring these issues can also pose safety risks, such as wobbly chairs or broken tables.</p>
