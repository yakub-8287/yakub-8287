<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat's Climate</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can wreak havoc on furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and decay:  Humidity causes wood to absorb moisture, leading to warping, cracking, and eventually rot.
   Pest infestations:  Warm, humid conditions create ideal breeding grounds for termites and other wood-boring insects.
   Fabric damage:  Moisture can cause mold and mildew to grow on upholstery, ruining its appearance and integrity.
   Loose joints and broken components:  Wear and tear, along with shifting temperatures, can loosen joints and cause furniture to become unstable.</p>
