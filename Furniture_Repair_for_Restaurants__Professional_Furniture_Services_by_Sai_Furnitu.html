<h2>2. The Problem: Common Restaurant Furniture Issues in Surat</h2>
<p>Restaurants in Surat, Gujarat, face specific challenges when it comes to furniture maintenance. The humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can lead to warping, cracking, and fading of wooden furniture.  High traffic and daily wear and tear further contribute to damage. This can result in costly replacements, safety hazards, and a diminished aesthetic appeal for your establishment.  Consider the potential damage to chairs near the kitchen, or the wear and tear on tables from daily use.  Ignoring these issues can lead to significant expense down the line.
