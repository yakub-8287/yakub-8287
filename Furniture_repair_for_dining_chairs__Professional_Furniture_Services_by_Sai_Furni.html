<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate poses significant challenges for wooden furniture.  Common issues we encounter include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  High humidity causes wood to expand and contract, leading to cracking and warping.
   Loose joints and broken legs: Frequent use and humidity can weaken joints and cause damage.
   Scratches and stains: Everyday wear and tear leave their mark on dining chairs.
   Upholstery damage: Fabric can tear, fade, or become stained over time.</p>
