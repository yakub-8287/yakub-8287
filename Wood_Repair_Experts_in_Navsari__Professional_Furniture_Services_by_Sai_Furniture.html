<h2>2. Common Furniture Problems and their Solutions in Surat</h2>
<p>The humid climate and fluctuating temperatures in Surat can wreak havoc on your wooden furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Cracks and Splits:  Changes in humidity cause wood to expand and contract, leading to unsightly cracks.
 Water Damage: Spills and exposure to moisture can cause warping, swelling, and rot.
 Scratches and Dents: Everyday wear and tear can leave your furniture looking less than its best.
 Pest Infestation:  Termites and other pests can cause significant structural damage.
 Faded Finishes: Exposure to sunlight and dust can dull the original finish.</p>
<p>Ignoring these problems can lead to costly repairs down the line and, in some cases, irreversible damage.  Moreover, damaged furniture can pose safety hazards, especially if it's unstable or structurally compromised.</p>
