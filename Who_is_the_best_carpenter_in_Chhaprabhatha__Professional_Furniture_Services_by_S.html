 Pest infestations:  The warm, humid climate can attract termites and other wood-boring insects.
 Loose joints and broken components:  Regular wear and tear can loosen joints and cause damage to furniture pieces.
 Upholstery damage:  Sun exposure and spills can quickly damage upholstery fabrics.</p>
