   Sun damage: Prolonged sun exposure can fade finishes and crack the wood.
   Accidental damage:  Everyday wear and tear, scratches, and broken parts are common occurrences.</p>
<p>Ignoring these issues can lead to significant costs, including complete furniture replacement, and even safety hazards.  A broken chair leg, for example, could cause a fall.</p>
