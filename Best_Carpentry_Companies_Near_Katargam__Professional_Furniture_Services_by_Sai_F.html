 Pest infestations:  Termites and other insects thrive in humid conditions, potentially damaging the structural integrity of your furniture.
 Cracks and splits: Temperature changes cause wood to expand and contract, creating unsightly cracks and splits.
 Loose joints and broken pieces:  Daily wear and tear can weaken joints and lead to breakage, especially on older pieces.
