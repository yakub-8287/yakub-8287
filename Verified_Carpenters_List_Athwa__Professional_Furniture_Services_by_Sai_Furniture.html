<h2>The Challenges of Furniture Maintenance in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating temperatures and humidity, presents unique challenges to furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood warping and cracking:  The intense heat and humidity can cause wooden furniture to warp, crack, or become unstable.
   Pest infestations:  Certain insects thrive in humid conditions, damaging wooden structures and fabrics.
   Fading and discoloration:  Prolonged exposure to sunlight can cause furniture fabrics and finishes to fade and discolor.
   Structural damage:  Accidental damage or wear and tear require professional repairs to maintain safety and structural integrity.  Improper repairs can lead to further damage and safety hazards.</p>
