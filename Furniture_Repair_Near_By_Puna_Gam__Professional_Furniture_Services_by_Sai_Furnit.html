<h2>2. Common Furniture Problems in Surat: Understanding the Challenges</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperatures, poses significant challenges to furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  The high humidity can lead to wood swelling, cracking, and even rot, particularly in older furniture pieces.
 Upholstery damage:  Spills, tears, and wear and tear are common problems affecting the upholstery of sofas, chairs, and other upholstered furniture.
 Loose joints and broken legs:  Years of use can weaken joints and lead to instability, making furniture unsafe to use.
 Pest infestation:  Termites and other wood-boring insects are a significant threat to wooden furniture, especially in older homes.</p>
<p>These problems not only affect the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but can also lead to significant costs in the long run, including potential safety hazards.  Ignoring these issues can result in more extensive damage and much higher repair bills.</p>
