<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>

<p>Wood warping and cracking:  The high humidity causes wood to absorb moisture, leading to warping, cracking, and splitting.
 Pest infestation:  Warm, humid conditions create ideal breeding grounds for termites and other wood-boring insects.
 Loose joints and damaged finishes:  Frequent use and the effects of the Surat climate can loosen joints and damage the finish of your furniture.
 Outdated styles:  You might want to modernize your furniture to suit contemporary trends.</p>
