<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat's Climate</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, can wreak havoc on your furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  Excess moisture leads to wood deterioration and warping, especially in wooden furniture.
   Polishing damage:  Extreme temperature fluctuations can cause cracking and peeling of furniture polish.
   Pest infestation:  Humidity provides a breeding ground for insects that can damage wooden structures and upholstery.
   Fabric fading:  Direct sunlight can cause fading and discoloration of fabrics.
   Metal rust:  Exposure to moisture can cause rusting on metallic components.</p>
