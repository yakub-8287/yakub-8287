<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat, with its hot and humid climate, poses unique challenges for furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and termite damage:  High humidity can lead to wood rot and attract termites, compromising the structural integrity of your furniture.
 Cracks and warping: Fluctuating temperatures cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks and warping in furniture.
 Loose joints and damaged finishes:  Regular use and wear and tear can loosen joints and damage the finish of your furniture.
 Upholstery wear and tear:  Sunlight and regular use can fade and damage upholstery.</p>
<p>These issues not only impact the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but also create safety hazards, especially for items like chairs and tables.  Ignoring these problems can lead to costly replacements down the line.</p>
