<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat &amp; Mahidharpura</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can significantly affect your furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  The high humidity can cause wooden furniture to absorb moisture, leading to warping, cracking, and even rot.
 Pest infestation:  Termites and other wood-boring insects thrive in humid conditions, causing significant damage to furniture.
 Loose joints and broken pieces:  Daily wear and tear can lead to loose joints, broken legs, and other structural damage.
 Outdated styles:  Your existing furniture might no longer match your home's current aesthetic.</p>
