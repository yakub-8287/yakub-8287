<h2>The Challenges of School Furniture in Surat</h2>
<p>Schools in Surat face unique challenges when it comes to maintaining their furniture.  The hot and humid climate of Gujarat can cause warping, cracking, and deterioration of wooden furniture.  Frequent use by students can lead to wear and tear, damage to upholstery, and broken components.

Furthermore, the cost of replacing entire sets of school furniture can strain a school's budget significantly.</p>
