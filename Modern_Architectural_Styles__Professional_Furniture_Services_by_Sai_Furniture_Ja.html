<h2>Common Furniture Issues in Surat's Climate</h2>
<p>Surat's unique climate presents several challenges for furniture. The high humidity can lead to warping, cracking, and mildew growth in wooden pieces, especially those crafted using traditional Gujarati techniques.  High temperatures can also cause finishes to fade or peel.  These issues not only detract from the aesthetic appeal but can also compromise the structural integrity of your furniture, leading to costly repairs or even replacements down the line. Ignoring these problems can also pose safety risks, especially with older, damaged pieces.</p>
