<h2>2. Problem Statement: Common Furniture Issues in Surat's Commercial Spaces</h2>
<p>Surat's unique climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, can significantly impact the lifespan of commercial furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  The humid Surat climate can cause wood to absorb moisture, leading to rot, warping, and structural damage.
   Fabric wear and tear:  High traffic in commercial spaces accelerates fabric wear, especially in high-use areas like waiting rooms or lobbies.
   Metal corrosion:  Exposure to humidity and dust can cause rust and corrosion on metal furniture frames.
   Upholstery stains and tears: Spills and everyday wear and tear can leave upholstery looking unsightly.</p>
