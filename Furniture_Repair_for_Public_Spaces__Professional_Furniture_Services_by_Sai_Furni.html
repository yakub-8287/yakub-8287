<h2>Common Furniture Issues in Surat's Public Spaces</h2>
<p>Surat's unique climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, presents significant challenges for public space furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and decay:  Moisture damage is a major concern, leading to warping, cracking, and structural weakening, especially in wooden benches and tables near the Tapi River.
 Fabric and upholstery wear:  High usage in parks and public areas leads to rapid deterioration of fabrics, requiring professional cleaning or replacement.
 Metal corrosion:  Exposure to the elements causes rust and corrosion on metal furniture, impacting both appearance and safety.
 Loose joints and broken components:  Constant use can loosen joints and cause structural damage, creating safety hazards.</p>
<p>Ignoring these issues not only impacts the visual appeal of your public spaces but also leads to increased repair costs in the long run and potential safety risks for the public.</p>
