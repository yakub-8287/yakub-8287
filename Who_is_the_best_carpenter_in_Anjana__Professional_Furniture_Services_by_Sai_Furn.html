<h2>The Furniture Problems Facing Surat Residents</h2>
<p>Surat's unique climate, with its high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, presents several challenges for furniture.  Common problems include:</p>

 Pest infestations:  Warm, humid conditions create ideal breeding grounds for termites and other wood-boring insects.
 Fabric damage:  Excessive humidity can cause fabric upholstery to mildew or become stained.
 Loose joints and broken pieces:  Years of use can cause furniture joints to loosen or components to break.</p>
