<h2>2. Common Furniture Problems in Surat: Understanding the Challenges</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate presents unique challenges for your furniture.  High humidity can lead to wood rot, warping, and the growth of mildew, particularly on pieces made of untreated wood.  Temperature fluctuations can also cause cracks, splitting, and loosen joints.  These problems not only affect the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but can also compromise its structural integrity, leading to safety hazards.  Furthermore, replacing damaged furniture can be costly, especially for antique or custom-made pieces. Ignoring minor issues can lead to more extensive and expensive repairs down the line.  The cost of replacing a damaged piece, especially if it holds sentimental value, is often far greater than the cost of professional repair.</p>
