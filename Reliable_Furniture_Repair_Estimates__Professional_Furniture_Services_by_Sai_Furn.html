<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat: Why You Need Expert Help</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can significantly impact the condition of your furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  The humidity causes wood to absorb moisture, leading to swelling, cracking, and even rot.
   Upholstery damage: Dust mites, moisture, and general wear and tear can affect the fabric and padding of your sofas, chairs, and other upholstered furniture.
   Pest infestation:  Certain insects thrive in humid conditions and can damage wooden furniture.
   Loose joints and broken parts: Regular use, especially with antique pieces, often results in structural damage.</p>
<p>Ignoring these problems can lead to costly repairs down the line and may even pose safety risks.  A reliable furniture repair estimate from a professional will help prevent larger, more expensive issues.</p>
