<h2>The Problem: Furniture Issues in Surat's Climate</h2>
<p>Surat's unique climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperatures, can significantly impact your furniture.  The intense heat and humidity can cause fabrics to fade, crack, and become brittle.  Exposure to dust and the frequent rains common in Gujarat can also lead to damage and deterioration.  Ignoring these problems can lead to more extensive (and costly) repairs down the line, potentially necessitating complete furniture replacement.  Furthermore, attempting DIY repairs can often worsen the damage and lead to safety hazards.</p>
