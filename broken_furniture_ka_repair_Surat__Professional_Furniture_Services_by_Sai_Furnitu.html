<p>Surat's climate, with its humidity and fluctuating temperatures, presents unique challenges for furniture.  Common problems include:</p>

   Cracked or broken joints:  Constant temperature shifts can weaken the joints in furniture, leading to cracks or breakage.

   Pest infestation:  Certain insects thrive in humid climates and can damage wooden furniture.</p>
