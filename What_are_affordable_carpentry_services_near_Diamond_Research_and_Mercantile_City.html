<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat: Why You Need Expert Help</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can significantly impact the longevity of your furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  Excessive moisture weakens wood, leading to rot and warping, especially in older pieces.
   Insect infestation:  Warm, humid conditions create ideal breeding grounds for wood-boring insects.
   Cracks and splits:  Changes in temperature and humidity can cause wood to expand and contract, resulting in cracks and splits.
   Damaged joints and veneers:  Normal wear and tear, along with accidental damage, can weaken or break furniture joints.</p>
<p>Ignoring these problems not only compromises the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but can also lead to costly replacements down the line.  Ignoring safety concerns associated with damaged furniture is equally risky.</p>
