<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>

<p>Wood warping and cracking:  Humidity causes wood to expand and contract, leading to unsightly cracks and warping.
   Pest infestation:  Warm, humid conditions create ideal breeding grounds for wood-boring insects.
   Loose joints and broken components:  Everyday wear and tear can weaken joints and cause breakage.
   Outdated styles:  Your furniture may simply no longer suit your taste or home décor.</p>
<p>These issues not only affect the aesthetics of your home but also pose safety risks and can lead to costly replacements.</p>
