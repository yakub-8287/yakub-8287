<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat: The Challenges of Our Climate</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its humidity and fluctuating temperatures, presents unique challenges for furniture.  Common problems include:</p>

   Pest infestation:  Warm, humid conditions can attract termites and other wood-boring insects.
   Fading and discoloration:  Sun exposure can cause furniture to fade or discolor over time.
   General wear and tear: Daily use inevitably leads to scratches, dents, and loose joints.</p>
<p>These issues can significantly impact the lifespan and aesthetic appeal of your furniture, leading to costly replacements if not addressed promptly. Ignoring these problems can also create safety hazards, like unstable chairs or broken table legs.</p>
