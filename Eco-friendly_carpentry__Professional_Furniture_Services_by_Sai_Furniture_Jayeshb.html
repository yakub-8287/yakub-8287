<p>Surat's climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, presents unique challenges for furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and decay:  Excessive moisture weakens wood structures, leading to warping, cracking, and infestations.
 Pest infestations:  Humidity can attract termites and other wood-boring insects, damaging your valuable furniture.
 Fading and discoloration:  The intense sun can cause furniture fabrics and finishes to fade prematurely.
 Structural damage:  Seasonal temperature changes can cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks and instability.  This is especially apparent in older furniture.</p>
