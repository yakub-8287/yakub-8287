<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat &amp; Their Solutions</h2>
<p>Surat, with its humid climate and varying temperatures, can take a toll on your furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping: The humidity can cause wood to expand and contract, leading to warping, cracking, and ultimately, rot.
 Loose joints and broken components: Constant use, coupled with the effects of the climate, often leads to weakened joints and broken parts.
 Pest infestation:  Termites and other wood-boring insects are a significant problem in many parts of Surat.
 Scratches and damage: Everyday wear and tear can leave your furniture looking less than its best.</p>
