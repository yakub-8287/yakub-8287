<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat: Why You Need a Carpenter</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate presents significant challenges for furniture.  The intense heat and fluctuating humidity can cause wood to warp, crack, and become susceptible to pest infestations.  Additionally, the constant wear and tear of daily life can lead to broken joints, damaged finishes, and loose components. Ignoring these issues can lead to escalating costs and potential safety hazards, ultimately requiring more extensive and expensive repairs down the line.  For example, a seemingly minor crack in a wooden chair leg, if left unattended, could lead to a complete collapse, potentially causing injury.</p>
