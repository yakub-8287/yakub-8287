   Pest infestations:  Warm, humid conditions create a breeding ground for termites and other wood-boring insects.
   Fabric fading and discoloration:  Sunlight and humidity can cause fabrics to lose their vibrancy.
   Structural damage:  Improper handling or age can lead to cracks, loose joints, and instability in furniture.</p>
