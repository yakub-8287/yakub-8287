<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat Cafes</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate presents unique challenges for cafe furniture.  High humidity can lead to warping, mildew, and rotting in wooden furniture, while extreme temperatures can cause materials to crack or fade.  Frequent use inevitably results in wear and tear, from scratches and dents to broken legs and loose joints. These issues not only affect the appearance of your cafe but also pose safety risks to your customers. Ignoring these problems can lead to costly replacements down the line.  For instance, neglecting a damaged chair could lead to a customer injury and subsequent legal issues.</p>
