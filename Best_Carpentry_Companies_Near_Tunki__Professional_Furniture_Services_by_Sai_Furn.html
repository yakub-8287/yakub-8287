<p>Surat's climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, significantly impacts furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and decay:  Excessive moisture can weaken wood, leading to structural damage and the need for extensive repairs.
 Cracked and warped surfaces: Temperature changes cause wood to expand and contract, resulting in cracks and warping, affecting both aesthetics and functionality.
 Pest infestation:  Warm and humid conditions can attract termites and other wood-boring insects, leading to costly damage and potential safety risks.
 Outdated styles:  Updating your furniture can significantly improve your home's aesthetics and value.</p>
<p>Ignoring these issues can lead to escalating costs, safety hazards, and the eventual need for complete furniture replacement.</p>
