<h2>The Problem: Damaged Furniture in Surat's Climate</h2>
<p>Surat's unique climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperatures, presents significant challenges for furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  The humid monsoon season can lead to wood damage, weakening the structural integrity of your furniture.
 Cracks and splits:  Temperature fluctuations cause expansion and contraction of wood, resulting in unsightly cracks and splits, especially in older pieces.
 Pest infestations:  Certain insects thrive in humid environments, damaging wooden furniture and upholstery.
 Upholstery wear and tear:  Daily use and exposure to sunlight can cause fading, tearing, and general wear and tear on upholstery.</p>
