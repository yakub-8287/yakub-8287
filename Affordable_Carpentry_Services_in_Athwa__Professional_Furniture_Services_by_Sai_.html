<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat &amp; Athwa</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, presents several challenges for furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood warping and cracking:  The humidity can cause wood to swell and shrink, leading to cracks and warping.
   Pest infestation:  Termites and other insects are attracted to wooden furniture, causing significant damage.
   Loose joints and broken parts:  Regular use and wear and tear can weaken joints and break furniture components.
   Upholstery wear and tear:  Sun exposure and regular use can fade and damage upholstery.</p>
<p>These issues not only impact the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but also pose safety risks.  Ignoring these problems can lead to expensive repairs later on.  A timely intervention by professionals is often the most economical approach.</p>
