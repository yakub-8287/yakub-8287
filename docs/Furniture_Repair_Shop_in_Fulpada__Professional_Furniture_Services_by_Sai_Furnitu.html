<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can significantly impact your furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  The humidity can cause wood to swell, crack, and even rot, particularly in older pieces.
   Upholstery damage:  Wear and tear, spills, and sun exposure can quickly deteriorate upholstery fabrics.
   Loose joints and broken components:  Over time, furniture joints can loosen, leading to instability and safety hazards.
   Pest infestation:  Certain insects can infest wooden furniture, causing structural damage.</p>
<p>These problems not only affect the aesthetics of your furniture but can also pose safety risks. Repairing damaged furniture is often far more economical than buying replacements, especially for antique or heirloom pieces.</p>
