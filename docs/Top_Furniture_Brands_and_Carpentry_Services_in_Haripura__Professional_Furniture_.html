<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat &amp; Their Solutions</h2>
<p>Surat, with its unique climate characterized by fluctuating humidity and temperature, presents several challenges for furniture.  Common issues include:</p>

 Pest infestations:  Certain climates can lead to infestations, causing further damage to wood and upholstery.</p>
