 Cracks and splits:  Temperature changes cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks and splits in furniture frames and surfaces.
 Upholstery damage:  Humidity can cause mildew and mold growth in fabric upholstery, creating an unpleasant smell and potentially causing health problems.
 Loose joints and broken components:  General wear and tear can result in unstable furniture and safety hazards.</p>
