<h2>Common Furniture Issues in Surat Homes</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate presents unique challenges for furniture.  Wood can warp, crack, or become infested with pests.  Older homes, particularly those with traditional Gujarati architectural features, often require specialized carpentry skills for repairs and renovations.  Ignoring these issues can lead to costly replacements and even safety hazards.  For example, a wobbly chair can lead to falls, and damaged window frames can compromise your home's security.  These problems can also impact the aesthetic appeal of your home, reducing its overall value.  Don't let damaged furniture detract from the beauty of your Surat home.</p>
