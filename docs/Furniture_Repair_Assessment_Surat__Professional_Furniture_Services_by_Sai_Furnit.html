<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>

<p>Wood rot and warping: Moisture damage is a major concern affecting both wooden and cane furniture prevalent in Surat homes.
   Fabric damage:  Sun exposure and humidity can lead to fading, mildew, and tears in upholstery.
   Pest infestations:  Termites and other wood-boring insects are common issues requiring professional treatment.
   Structural damage:  Accidents, wear and tear, or improper use can cause damage to the structure of your furniture.</p>
