<h2>Common Furniture Issues in Surat:  The Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate poses significant challenges for office furniture.  The constant temperature fluctuations can cause wood to warp, crack, and lose its structural integrity.  Excessive humidity leads to mold and mildew growth, damaging fabric upholstery and weakening wooden frames. This can result in costly repairs or even complete furniture replacement.  Beyond climate damage, everyday wear and tear, accidental damage, and inadequate maintenance contribute to furniture issues, creating safety hazards and impacting productivity.  Ignoring these problems can lead to escalating costs and disruptions to your workflow.</p>
