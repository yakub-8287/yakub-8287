<h2>Common Furniture Issues Facing Surat Institutions</h2>
<p>The hot and humid climate of Surat, Gujarat, presents unique challenges to furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and termite damage:  The damp conditions can lead to wood decay and infestation.
 Fabric wear and tear:  High usage in educational and healthcare settings leads to rapid deterioration of upholstery.
 Structural damage:  Heavy use can damage chair frames, table legs, and other structural elements.
 Sun damage:  Prolonged exposure to sunlight can fade finishes and damage wood.
 Vandalism:  Schools and public spaces are unfortunately susceptible to intentional damage.</p>
