<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat, with its unique climate, presents specific challenges to furniture.  The high humidity and fluctuating temperatures can lead to various issues, including:</p>

   Cracks and splits:  Changes in temperature can stress wood, causing it to crack.
   Pest infestation:  Certain insects thrive in humid conditions and can damage your furniture.
   Upholstery wear and tear:  Regular use and exposure to dust can damage the upholstery of your chairs and sofas.
   Loose joints and broken legs:  Years of use can weaken joints and cause structural damage.</p>
