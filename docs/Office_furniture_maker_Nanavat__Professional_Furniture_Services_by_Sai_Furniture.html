These problems not only impact the aesthetic appeal of your office but can also pose safety hazards and lead to costly replacements.  Ignoring these issues can ultimately affect productivity and create a less professional environment for your employees.  The high cost of replacing entire sets of office furniture is a significant concern for many businesses.</p>
