<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat Storage Units</h2>
<p>Surat's unique climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, can significantly impact stored furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  Excess moisture leads to wood damage, often resulting in cracks, warping, and structural weakening.
 Pest infestation:  Stored furniture can attract insects like termites and borers, leading to extensive damage.
 Scratching and chipping:  Improper handling during storage or movement can lead to surface damage.
 Fabric deterioration:  Moisture and lack of air circulation can damage upholstery and fabrics.</p>
<p>Ignoring these problems can lead to costly replacements and potential safety hazards.  Addressing issues early with professional repair is significantly more cost-effective than buying new furniture.</p>
