<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate presents unique challenges for furniture.  Wood can warp, crack, and become susceptible to pest infestation.  Frequent temperature fluctuations can cause expansion and contraction, leading to damage and instability.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and decay:  Due to high humidity.
   Loose joints and wobbly legs:  From everyday wear and tear.
   Scratches and dents:  From accidental impacts.
   Upholstery damage:  Tears, stains, and fading.
   Pest infestations:  Termites and borers can cause significant damage.</p>
<p>These issues can lead to significant costs if left unaddressed, potentially requiring complete furniture replacement.  Ignoring these problems can also pose safety hazards, particularly with unstable furniture.</p>
