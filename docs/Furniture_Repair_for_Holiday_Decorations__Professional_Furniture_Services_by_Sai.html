<h2>Common Furniture Issues in Surat:  The Holiday Challenge</h2>
<p>The humid Surat climate and frequent temperature fluctuations can significantly impact your furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and damage:  Excess moisture can lead to warping, cracking, and even rotting, especially in older pieces.
   Loose joints and broken components: The constant shifting of furniture during celebrations can exacerbate pre-existing damage.
   Scratches and dents:  Accidental bumps and scrapes are inevitable, particularly during busy holiday gatherings.
   Faded finishes: Exposure to sunlight and humidity can dull the vibrancy of your furniture's finish.</p>
