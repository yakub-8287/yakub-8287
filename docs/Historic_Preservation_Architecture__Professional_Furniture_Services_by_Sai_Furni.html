                <h1>Historic Preservation Architecture | Professional Furniture Services by Sai Furniture (Jayeshbhai)</h1>

<h2>Common Furniture Issues in Surat: The Challenge of Preservation</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures present significant challenges to preserving antique furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and decay:  Excess moisture leads to warping, cracking, and the infestation of wood-boring insects.
   Pest infestations:  Termites and other pests thrive in warm, humid conditions, damaging furniture structures.
   Fabric deterioration:  Humidity weakens fabrics, causing discoloration, mold, and structural damage.
   UV damage:  Sunlight can fade finishes and weaken wood fibers over time.</p>
<p>Ignoring these issues can lead to significant financial loss, potential safety hazards, and the irreplaceable loss of valuable heritage pieces.  Furthermore, the cost of repairs often increases exponentially with neglect.</p>
