<h2>The Furniture Problems Faced in Surat's Humid Climate</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate presents unique challenges for furniture.  The intense heat and moisture can cause wood to warp, crack, and become susceptible to pest infestation.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and fungal growth: High humidity encourages mold and mildew, damaging the structural integrity of your furniture.
   Cracked and warped wood: Fluctuations in temperature and humidity cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks and warping.
   Loose joints and broken components:  Years of use, combined with environmental factors, can weaken furniture joints and cause breakage.
   Pest infestation:  Warm, humid conditions can attract termites and other wood-boring insects, leading to significant damage.</p>
<p>Ignoring these problems can lead to costly repairs down the line, potentially even requiring complete furniture replacement.  Safety concerns can also arise from unstable or damaged furniture.</p>
