<h2>2. The Challenges Faced by Antique Furniture in Surat</h2>
<p>Suratâ€™s unique climate presents significant challenges for antique furniture.  The high humidity and fluctuating temperatures can lead to several issues, including:</p>
<p>Wood rot and decay:  Moisture seeps into the wood, causing damage and weakening the structure.
   Cracks and warping:  Changes in temperature and humidity cause the wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks and warping.
   Pest infestation:  Warm, humid conditions create the perfect breeding ground for wood-boring insects.
   Loose joints and broken parts:  Years of use inevitably lead to wear and tear.</p>
<p>Ignoring these problems can lead to irreparable damage, significantly diminishing the value and potentially compromising the safety of your antique furniture.  Repairing these issues promptly is essential to preserve its beauty and longevity.</p>
