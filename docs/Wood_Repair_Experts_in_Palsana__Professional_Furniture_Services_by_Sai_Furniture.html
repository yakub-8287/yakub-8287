These issues can be costly to repair, leading to hefty replacement costs or the need to dispose of perfectly functional furniture items. Ignoring damage can also lead to safety hazards.  Loose joints can become unstable, posing a risk to individuals, and water damage can harbor mold and mildew, affecting the air quality within your home.</p>
