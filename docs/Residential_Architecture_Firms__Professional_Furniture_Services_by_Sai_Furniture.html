<h2>The Challenges of Furniture in Surat's Climate</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures present unique challenges for furniture.  Wood can warp, expand, and crack, while fabrics can mildew or fade.  These issues not only affect the aesthetics of your home but can also compromise safety and lead to costly replacements.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and insect infestations: Humidity encourages the growth of fungi and attracts pests.
 Fabric damage:  Mildew and discoloration are common problems due to high humidity.
 Metal corrosion:  Rust and oxidation can weaken furniture frames and mechanisms.
 Structural damage:  Seasonal temperature fluctuations cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks and instability.</p>
