<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat: The Impact of Climate and Time</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate can significantly impact furniture.  Wood expands and contracts, leading to warping, cracking, and loosening joints.  Termites and other pests are also a common concern.  Additionally, daily wear and tear, accidental damage, and even the simple passage of time can cause significant damage.  Ignoring these issues can lead to more extensive (and expensive) repairs down the line, not to mention safety hazards.  These issues are prevalent across Surat, from the bustling markets near the Tapi River to the quieter residential areas.</p>
