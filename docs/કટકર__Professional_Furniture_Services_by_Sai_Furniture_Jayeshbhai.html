<h2>1. Introduction to કાટકર Services in Surat</h2>
<p>Is your cherished wooden furniture showing its age?  Scratches, cracks, or faded finishes?

<h2>2. Common Furniture Problems in Surat &amp; Their Solutions</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its humidity and fluctuating temperatures, can significantly impact furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  Humidity can cause wood to expand and contract, leading to warping, cracking, and even rot, especially in older pieces.
 Pest infestation:  Certain insects thrive in humid conditions and can damage wooden furniture.
 Sun damage:  Prolonged exposure to sunlight can cause fading and discoloration.
 Scratches and dents:  Everyday wear and tear can leave your furniture looking less than perfect.</p>
