<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat &amp; Kosamba</h2>
<p>The humid climate of Surat and Kosamba can significantly impact the lifespan of your furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and decay: Excessive moisture weakens wood, leading to cracks, warping, and structural damage.
   Pest infestations:  Termites and other wood-boring insects are prevalent in the region, causing significant damage.
   Sun damage: Prolonged exposure to sunlight can fade finishes and weaken wood fibers.
   General wear and tear: Everyday use inevitably leads to scratches, dents, and loose joints.</p>
<p>These issues not only affect the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but can also pose safety risks and lead to costly replacements.</p>
