<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures pose significant challenges to furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and decay:  Excess moisture weakens wood, leading to warping, cracking, and ultimately, structural damage.
   Pest infestation:  Warm and humid conditions create ideal breeding grounds for termites and other wood-boring insects.
   Loose joints and broken components:  Regular use and environmental factors can compromise the structural integrity of furniture.
   Faded finishes and worn upholstery:  Sun exposure and general wear and tear can diminish the aesthetic appeal of your furniture.</p>
<p>These problems can be costly to repair if not addressed promptly by professionals.  Attempting DIY repairs often leads to further damage and unnecessary expenses.  Moreover, improper handling of furniture repairs can also pose safety risks.</p>
