<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can significantly impact the lifespan of your furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  Excess moisture can cause wood to swell, crack, and even rot, especially in older pieces.

   Loose joints and broken components:  Normal wear and tear, coupled with environmental stress, can lead to structural issues.
   Faded finishes and peeling paint:  Sun exposure and humidity can dull the finish and cause paint to peel, reducing the aesthetic appeal of your furniture.
   Damaged upholstery:  Spills, tears, and general wear and tear can negatively impact your furniture.</p>
