<h2>The Problem: Surat's Climate and Your Furniture</h2>
<p>Surat, with its characteristically hot summers and humid monsoons, presents unique challenges for furniture.  The intense heat can cause wood to dry out and crack, while high humidity leads to warping, mildew, and pest infestations.  These issues aren't just cosmetic; they can compromise the structural integrity of your furniture, leading to costly repairs or even complete replacement.  Ignoring these problems can result in significant financial burdens and potentially dangerous situations, such as collapsing furniture.  Common issues we see include:</p>
<p>Cracked wooden surfaces
   Faded finishes
   Pest infestations (termites, woodworms)
   Mildew and mold growth
   Loose joints and unstable structures</p>
