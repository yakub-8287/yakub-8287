<h2>2. Common Furniture Problems in Surat:  Why You Need Repair Services</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can significantly impact your furniture.  Common issues include:</p>

 Insect infestation:  Certain insects thrive in humid conditions and can damage wood furniture.
 Upholstery wear and tear:  Daily use and exposure to sunlight can cause fabric to fade, tear, and lose its shape.
 Loose joints and broken components:  Normal wear and tear can lead to loose joints, broken legs, and other structural damage.</p>
