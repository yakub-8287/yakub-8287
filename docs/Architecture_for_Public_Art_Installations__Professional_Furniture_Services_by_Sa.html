   Metal corrosion:  Rust and oxidation affect metal components, compromising their strength and appearance.
   Fabric deterioration:  Sun exposure and humidity cause fading and weakening of fabrics used in outdoor installations.
   Vandalism and accidental damage:  Public spaces are vulnerable to damage from both intentional and accidental causes, requiring prompt and skillful repairs.</p>
