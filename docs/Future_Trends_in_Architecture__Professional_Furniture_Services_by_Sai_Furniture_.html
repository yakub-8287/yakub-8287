   Fabric damage:  Mold and mildew can easily develop on upholstery, impacting both appearance and hygiene.
   Structural weakness:  Exposure to the elements can weaken joints and frames.</p>
<p>Ignoring these problems leads to costly replacements and compromises the overall aesthetic of your home, which could be in line with the latest future trends in architecture.</p>
