<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate can significantly impact the longevity of your furniture.  Common problems include:</p>

 Pest infestation:  Warm temperatures create a breeding ground for termites and other wood-boring insects.
 Loose joints and broken pieces:  Daily wear and tear, coupled with environmental factors, can weaken furniture structures.
 Damaged finishes:  Sun exposure and humidity can cause paint or varnish to peel or crack.</p>
