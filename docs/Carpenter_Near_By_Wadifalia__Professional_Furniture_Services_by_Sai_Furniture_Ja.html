<h2>2. Common Furniture Problems in Surat: Why You Need a Professional</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, significantly impacts furniture.  Common issues include:</p>

 Pest infestation:  Warm, humid conditions attract termites and other wood-boring insects.
 Loose joints and broken components:  Regular wear and tear, especially in high-traffic areas, can cause furniture damage.
 Outdated finishes:  Over time, furniture finishes can fade, chip, or become scratched.</p>
<p>Ignoring these problems can lead to costly repairs down the line and compromise the safety of your furniture.</p>
