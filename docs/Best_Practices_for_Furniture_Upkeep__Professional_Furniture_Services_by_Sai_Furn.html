<h2>Common Furniture Issues in Surat: The Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, presents unique challenges for furniture.  Wooden pieces are particularly vulnerable to warping, cracking, and pest infestation.  Upholstery can suffer from mildew and staining. These issues not only detract from the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but can also lead to costly repairs or premature replacement. Ignoring these problems can also present safety concerns, such as loose joints or damaged structures.  The cost implications of neglecting proper maintenance can far outweigh the cost of proactive care.  For instance, a seemingly small scratch on a wooden table might escalate into significant damage if left unaddressed.</p>
