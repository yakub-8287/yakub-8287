<h2>The Problem:  Furniture Issues in Surat's Humid Climate</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, presents unique challenges for furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  The dampness can cause wood to expand, leading to warping, cracking, and eventually rot, especially in older pieces.
 Pest infestation:  High humidity provides ideal breeding grounds for termites and other wood-boring insects.
 Fading and discoloration:  Sunlight and humidity can cause furniture finishes to fade and lose their vibrancy.
 Loose joints and broken parts:  Years of wear and tear, exacerbated by climate changes, can result in structural instability.</p>
<p>These issues not only affect the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but can also lead to significant repair costs and safety hazards.</p>
