<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat Events</h2>
<p>Surat's unique climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, can significantly impact the condition of your furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  The humid Surat weather can lead to wood swelling and deterioration, particularly in older pieces.
   Upholstery damage:  Spills, stains, and tears can quickly ruin the look of upholstered furniture.
   Scratches and dents:  The bustling atmosphere of events can lead to accidental damage.
   Loose joints and broken legs:  Years of use can weaken furniture, causing instability.</p>
<p>These problems not only compromise the aesthetics of your event but can also pose safety hazards to your guests.  The cost of replacing damaged furniture can be substantial, making professional repair a significantly more economical option.</p>
