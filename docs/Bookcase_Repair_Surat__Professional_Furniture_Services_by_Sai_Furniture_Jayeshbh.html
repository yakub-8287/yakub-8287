<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can severely damage wooden furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  Excessive moisture weakens wood, leading to rot and warping, especially in bookcases made of less durable woods.
   Cracks and splits: Temperature changes can cause wood to expand and contract, creating cracks and splits.
   Pest infestation:  Warm and humid conditions can attract termites and other wood-boring insects.
   Loose joints and broken shelves:  Years of use can loosen joints and lead to broken shelves, rendering your bookcase unsafe and unstable.</p>
<p>These problems can not only affect the appearance of your bookcase but also pose safety risks and lead to costly replacements. Timely professional repair saves you money in the long run and ensures the safety of your family and belongings.</p>
