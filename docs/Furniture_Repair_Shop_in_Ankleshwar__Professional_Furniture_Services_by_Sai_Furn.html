<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>The humid climate of Surat, coupled with fluctuating temperatures, presents unique challenges for furniture.  Common issues we encounter include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  Excess moisture can cause wood to expand and crack, leading to structural damage.
 Polishing and finish damage:  Scratches, chips, and fading are common problems caused by daily use and environmental factors.
 Upholstery wear and tear: Fabrics can fade, tear, and become stained over time, impacting both appearance and comfort.
 Loose joints and broken pieces: Regular wear and tear can loosen joints or even cause complete breakage.
 Pest infestation:  Certain wood-boring insects thrive in humid environments and can cause extensive damage.</p>
