<h2>2.  The Problem: Common Furniture Issues in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuations in temperature and humidity, presents unique challenges for furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  High humidity can cause wood to absorb moisture, leading to rotting and warping, especially in pieces made of less durable woods.
   Cracked and damaged finishes:  Changes in temperature can cause finishes to crack and peel, leaving your furniture vulnerable to further damage.
   Loose joints and structural instability: Over time, the joints in your furniture can loosen, compromising its stability and safety.
   Pest infestations:  Certain wood-boring insects thrive in humid conditions, causing significant damage to wooden furniture.<br />
   Upholstery wear and tear:  Daily use takes a toll on upholstery, leading to tears, stains, and overall deterioration.</p>
