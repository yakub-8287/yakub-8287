<h2>2. Common Furniture Problems in Surat &amp; Their Solutions</h2>
<p>The humid climate of Surat, coupled with fluctuating temperatures, can cause significant damage to your furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping: The high humidity encourages the growth of mold and fungi, weakening wood structures and causing warping.
 Cracked or broken joints:  Fluctuating temperatures can cause wood to expand and contract, leading to stress fractures and broken joints.
 Faded finishes:  Exposure to sunlight and humidity can cause the finish on your furniture to fade and lose its luster.
 Pest infestation:  Certain insects are attracted to wood, causing further damage and compromising the structural integrity of your furniture.</p>
