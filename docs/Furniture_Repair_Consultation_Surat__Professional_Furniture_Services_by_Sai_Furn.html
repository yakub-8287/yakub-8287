<p>Wood rot and warping:  High humidity can lead to wood expansion and decay, especially in poorly maintained pieces.
 Pest infestation:  Certain insects thrive in humid conditions and can damage furniture.
 Fabric wear and tear:  Heat and sun exposure can fade fabric and cause it to fray.
 Loose joints and broken parts:  Daily wear and tear can weaken joints and lead to breakages.
 Scratching and scuffs:  This is especially noticeable on polished surfaces common in many Surat homes.</p>
