<h2>The Problem: Furniture Damage in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat, with its vibrant culture and beautiful homes, often faces challenges preserving furniture from damage.  The climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, can wreak havoc on wood, fabric, and upholstery.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping: Due to excessive moisture.
   Upholstery wear and tear: From daily use and exposure to sunlight.
   Insect infestation:  Common in older furniture pieces.
   Structural damage: From accidents or improper handling.</p>
<p>These problems not only diminish the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but also carry significant cost implications – replacing damaged pieces can be expensive.  Ignoring damage can lead to safety hazards, especially with unstable or weakened structures.</p>
