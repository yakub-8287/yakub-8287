Ignoring minor damage can lead to significant problems down the line, impacting both the aesthetic appeal and structural integrity of your pieces.  Safety concerns can also arise from damaged furniture, posing risks to children and adults. For example, a wobbly chair or a broken table leg could cause injury.</p>
