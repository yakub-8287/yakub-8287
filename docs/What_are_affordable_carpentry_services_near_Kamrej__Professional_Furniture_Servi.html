<h2>The Problem: Furniture Distress in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate can wreak havoc on your furniture.  Wood expands and contracts, leading to warping, cracking, and loosening joints.

Repairing or replacing damaged furniture can be expensive, making it crucial to find affordable yet professional solutions.
