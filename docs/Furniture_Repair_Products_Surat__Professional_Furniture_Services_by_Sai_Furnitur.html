<h2>2. Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating temperatures and high humidity, can significantly impact your furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  Moisture damage is a major problem, causing wood to rot, warp, and crack.
   Pest infestation:  Termites and other insects thrive in humid conditions, damaging furniture structures.
   Fading and discoloration:  Sunlight and humidity can cause finishes to fade and discolor over time.
   Scratches and dents:  Daily wear and tear inevitably leads to surface damage.</p>
<p>These problems not only diminish the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but also impact its structural integrity and longevity. Repairing damaged furniture is often far more cost-effective than purchasing replacements, especially for valuable antique pieces.  Ignoring these issues can lead to further, more expensive damage down the line, potentially compromising safety.</p>
