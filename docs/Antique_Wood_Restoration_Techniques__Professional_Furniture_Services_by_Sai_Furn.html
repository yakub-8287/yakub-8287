                <h1>Antique Wood Restoration Techniques | Professional Furniture Services by Sai Furniture (Jayeshbhai)</h1>

<h2>2. Common Furniture Issues in Surat: The Challenges Faced</h2>
<p>The Surat climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperatures, presents unique challenges to wooden furniture.  High humidity can lead to wood rot, warping, and insect infestations, while extreme heat can cause cracking and dryness.  These issues are common across various furniture types, from traditional Gujarati styles to more modern pieces. Neglecting these problems can lead to costly repairs or even irreparable damage. Ignoring damaged furniture also poses safety risks â€“ unstable pieces can be dangerous, especially in homes with children.  The cost of replacing antique furniture far surpasses the cost of professional restoration.</p>
