<h2>2. Common Furniture Problems in Surat:  The Need for Expert Carpentry</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperatures, can significantly impact furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood warping and cracking:  Extreme humidity causes wood to expand and contract, leading to warping and cracking.
 Pest infestations:  Termites and other wood-boring insects thrive in humid conditions, causing irreparable damage.
 Loose joints and broken components:  Wear and tear, along with accidental damage, can weaken furniture structures.
 Outdated or damaged finishes:  Years of use can leave furniture looking dull and worn.</p>

 Increased long-term costs: A poorly executed repair can necessitate more expensive fixes down the line.
 Safety risks: Improper handling of tools or materials can lead to injury.
