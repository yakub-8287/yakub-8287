<h2>2.  The Problem:  Furniture Challenges in Surat's Climate</h2>
<p>Surat, with its vibrant culture and frequent gatherings, faces unique challenges when it comes to furniture maintenance. The humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can cause:</p>
<p>Wood warping and cracking:  The high humidity can lead to wood expanding and contracting, causing cracks and warping, especially in older pieces.
 Upholstery damage:  Moisture can lead to mold and mildew growth in upholstery, impacting the aesthetics and hygiene of your furniture.
 Loose joints and broken parts: Frequent use during events can weaken furniture structures, resulting in broken legs, loose joints, and damaged frames.
 Unsightly scratches and stains:  Accidents happen, leaving behind scratches, stains, and other imperfections that detract from the overall look.
 Significant repair costs if neglected: Delaying repairs can often mean more extensive (and costly) work later on.</p>
