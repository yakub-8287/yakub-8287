<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate presents unique challenges for furniture.  Monsoons and temperature fluctuations can cause:</p>

   Insect infestation:  Warm, damp conditions attract pests like termites and wood-boring beetles.
   Fading and discoloration:  Prolonged sun exposure can fade the finish and color of your furniture.
   Upholstery damage:  Moisture can lead to mold and mildew growth in upholstery, impacting its aesthetic appeal and structural integrity.</p>
