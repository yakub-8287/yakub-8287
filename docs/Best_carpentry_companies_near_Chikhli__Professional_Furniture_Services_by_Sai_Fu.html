 Pest infestations:  Warm and humid conditions can attract termites and other wood-boring insects.
 Faded finishes: Sunlight can cause furniture finishes to fade and lose their luster.
 Outdated or damaged upholstery: Over time, upholstery can wear down or become damaged, requiring repair or replacement.  These issues not only detract from the aesthetics of your home but also come with costly repair bills and potential safety concerns.</p>
