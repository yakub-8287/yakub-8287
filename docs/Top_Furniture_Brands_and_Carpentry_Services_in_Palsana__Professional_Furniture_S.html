<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat:  Why You Need Professional Help</h2>
<p>The humid Surat climate presents unique challenges for furniture.  Exposure to high temperatures and humidity can lead to:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  Especially common in older furniture pieces and those made with less durable materials.
 Insect infestation:  Termites and other pests thrive in humid conditions, damaging your valuable furniture.
 Fabric fading and wear:  The sun's intense rays and fluctuating humidity can cause fabric to fade, tear, and lose its quality.
 Structural damage:  Over time, furniture can become unstable, leading to safety hazards and costly replacements.</p>
