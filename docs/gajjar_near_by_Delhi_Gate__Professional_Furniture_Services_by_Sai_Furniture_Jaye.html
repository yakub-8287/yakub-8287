<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, characterized by high humidity and temperature fluctuations, significantly impacts furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  Excessive moisture causes wood to swell, crack, and rot, weakening its structure.
   Insect infestations:  Warm, humid conditions create ideal breeding grounds for wood-boring insects, leading to extensive damage.
   Upholstery wear and tear:  Sun exposure and frequent use cause fabrics to fade, tear, and lose their shape.
   Loose joints and broken parts:  Regular use and accidental damage can loosen joints and break components.</p>
