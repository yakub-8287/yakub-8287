<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat: A Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, presents unique challenges for furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and decay:  The humid climate encourages the growth of mold and fungi, weakening wooden structures.
 Insect infestation:  Termites and other wood-boring insects thrive in warm, damp environments, compromising the integrity of furniture.
 Structural damage:  Over time, aging and improper care can lead to cracks, warping, and loose joints, especially in older pieces.
 Fabric deterioration:  High humidity and intense sunlight can cause upholstery fabrics to fade, weaken, and tear.
 Aesthetic degradation:  Scratches, stains, and general wear and tear diminish the beauty and value of your furniture.</p>
<p>Ignoring these problems can lead to costly repairs or even irreversible damage, not to mention safety hazards.</p>
