<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat &amp; Mahidharpura</h2>
<p>Surat, with its humid climate and fluctuating temperatures, presents unique challenges for furniture.  Exposure to monsoon rains and intense summer heat can cause wood to warp, crack, and become susceptible to pest infestation. This is particularly true in older homes and traditional Gujarati style furniture.  These issues not only impact the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but can also lead to safety hazards, such as loose joints or splintering wood.  Ignoring these problems can lead to expensive replacements down the line.  Furthermore, finding reliable and experienced carpenters in Mahidharpura can be a challenge.</p>
