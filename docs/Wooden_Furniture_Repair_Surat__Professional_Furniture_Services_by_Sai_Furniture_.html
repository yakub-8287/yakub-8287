<h2>The Challenges of Furniture in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, poses significant challenges to wooden furniture.  Exposure to moisture can lead to warping, cracking, and the growth of mold and mildew.  Extreme temperatures can cause the wood to expand and contract, leading to further damage.  Neglecting these issues can lead to expensive repairs or even complete furniture replacement.  Furthermore, attempting DIY repairs without the necessary expertise can often result in further damage and safety hazards.  These problems affect both traditional Gujarati furniture styles and modern designs equally.</p>
