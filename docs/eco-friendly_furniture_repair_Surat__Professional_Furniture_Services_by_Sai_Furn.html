<h2>2. The Challenges of Furniture in Surat's Climate</h2>
<p>Surat, with its humid climate and fluctuating temperatures, presents unique challenges for furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and damage:  Humidity can lead to mold, mildew, and wood decay, especially in poorly ventilated areas.
 Cracked and faded finishes:  Extreme temperatures and sun exposure can cause finishes to crack, peel, and fade, compromising the aesthetics and structural integrity of your furniture.
 Pest infestations:  Certain climatic conditions can attract wood-boring insects and other pests that damage furniture.
 High repair costs: Replacing damaged furniture can be expensive, especially when dealing with antique or unique pieces.</p>

We prioritize methods that minimize waste and preserve the original character of the piece.
