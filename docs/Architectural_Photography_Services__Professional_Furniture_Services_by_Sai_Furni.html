These problems not only detract from the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but can also lead to costly repairs or even replacement.  Neglecting these issues can also pose safety risks, especially with older pieces.  The cost of replacing damaged furniture can be significant, impacting both residential and commercial spaces.</p>
