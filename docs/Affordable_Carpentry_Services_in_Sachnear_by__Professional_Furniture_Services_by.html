<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate can wreak havoc on your furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  High humidity leads to wood expansion and cracking, particularly in older, untreated pieces.
 Pest infestations:  Warm temperatures create ideal breeding grounds for termites and other wood-boring insects.
 Sun damage:  Prolonged sun exposure can fade finishes and cause cracking in the wood.
 Loose joints and broken components:  Daily use can lead to wear and tear, necessitating repairs.</p>
<p>These issues can quickly escalate in cost if left unaddressed, ultimately requiring more extensive and expensive repairs down the line. Ignoring such issues also poses safety risks, especially if broken furniture pieces are left unattended.</p>
