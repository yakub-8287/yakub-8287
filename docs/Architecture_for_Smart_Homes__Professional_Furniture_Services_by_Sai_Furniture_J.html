 Pest infestation:  Warm, humid conditions provide ideal breeding grounds for insects that can damage your furniture.
 Fabric deterioration:  Moisture can lead to mildew and mold growth on upholstery, reducing its lifespan.
 High repair costs:  Neglecting these issues can lead to costly repairs or even complete furniture replacement.</p>
