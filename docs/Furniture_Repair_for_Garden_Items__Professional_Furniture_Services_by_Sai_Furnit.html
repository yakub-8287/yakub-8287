<h2>Common Problems with Garden Furniture in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate, coupled with occasional monsoons, takes its toll on outdoor furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and decay:  High humidity promotes fungal growth, leading to weakening and structural damage.
   Wicker damage:  Sun exposure and rain can cause wicker to become brittle and break.
   Metal rust and corrosion:  Exposure to moisture accelerates rust formation on metal frames.
   Fabric fading and tearing:  Sunlight and constant exposure to the elements wear down fabric cushions.
   Loose joints and structural instability: Over time, constant use and weather conditions loosen joints and compromise furniture stability, creating safety hazards.</p>
