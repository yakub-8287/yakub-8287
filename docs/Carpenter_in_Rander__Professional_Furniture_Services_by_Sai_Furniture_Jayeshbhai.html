<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate presents unique challenges for your furniture.  The intense heat and fluctuating humidity can lead to:</p>
<p>Wood warping and cracking:  The expansion and contraction of wood due to climate changes causes damage.
 Pest infestations:  Warm, humid conditions create ideal breeding grounds for wood-boring insects.
 Finish deterioration:  High humidity can cause paint and varnish to peel or blister.
 Joint loosening:  Changes in moisture levels can weaken the structural integrity of your furniture.</p>
<p>Ignoring these problems can lead to costly repairs down the line, or even complete furniture replacement.  Furthermore, damaged furniture can pose safety hazards, especially if it becomes unstable.</p>
