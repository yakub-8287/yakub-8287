<h2>The Problem: Furniture Issues in Surat's Climate</h2>
<p>Surat's unique climate, with its high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, presents significant challenges to furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  High humidity can cause wood to absorb moisture, leading to rot and warping, particularly in older furniture pieces.
 Pest infestations:  Warm temperatures create ideal breeding grounds for wood-boring insects, damaging furniture beyond repair if left untreated.
 Cracks and splits:  Temperature fluctuations cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks and splits in the furniture's structure.
 Loose joints and broken parts:  Normal wear and tear, coupled with climate challenges, can weaken joints and cause parts to break.</p>
<p>These issues not only impact the aesthetics of your furniture but also pose safety risks and significant repair costs.</p>
