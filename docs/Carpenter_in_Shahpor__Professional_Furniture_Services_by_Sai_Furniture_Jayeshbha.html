   Cracked and damaged joints:  Changes in temperature can cause wood to expand and contract, weakening joints and causing cracks.
   Pest infestations:  Warm and humid conditions create the perfect breeding ground for wood-boring insects.
   Damaged upholstery and finishes:  Accidental damage, wear and tear, and exposure to the elements can compromise the aesthetic appeal of your furniture.</p>
