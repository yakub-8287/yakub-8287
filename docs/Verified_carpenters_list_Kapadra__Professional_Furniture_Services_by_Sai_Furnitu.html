<h2>The Problem with Damaged Furniture in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, can wreak havoc on your precious furniture.  Common problems include:</p>

   Pest infestation:  Termites and other pests are common in the region and can severely damage wooden furniture.
   Upholstery wear and tear:  Constant use and exposure to sunlight can damage upholstery fabrics.
   Loose joints and broken components:  Accidental damage or wear and tear can lead to structural issues.</p>
