                <h1>Antique Furniture Restoration | Professional Furniture Services by Sai Furniture (Jayeshbhai)</h1>

<h2>The Challenges of Antique Furniture in Surat's Climate</h2>
<p>Surat's unique climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperatures, presents significant challenges for antique furniture.  Wood can warp, crack, and become susceptible to pest infestation.  This can lead to costly repairs, structural damage, and even the complete loss of a valuable piece.  Ignoring these issues can also create safety hazards, especially if the damage compromises the structural integrity of the piece.  The cost of replacing a damaged antique often far exceeds the cost of professional restoration.</p>
