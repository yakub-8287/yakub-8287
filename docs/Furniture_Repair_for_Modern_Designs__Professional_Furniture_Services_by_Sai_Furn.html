<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>

   Loose joints and broken legs:  Over time, furniture can become unstable, posing safety risks.
   Fabric tears and stains:  Accidents happen, but our professional cleaning and repair services can revive damaged upholstery.
   Water damage:  Sudden monsoonal rains or spills can cause significant damage, requiring prompt intervention.  Ignoring these issues can lead to costly repairs down the line, sometimes necessitating complete replacement.</p>
