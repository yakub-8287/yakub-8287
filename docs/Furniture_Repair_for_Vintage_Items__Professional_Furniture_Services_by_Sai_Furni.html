<h2>Common Furniture Issues in Surat &amp; Their Solutions</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperatures, poses unique challenges to furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and decay:  The high humidity can lead to wood rot, especially in older, untreated furniture.
 Cracked and warped wood: Temperature fluctuations cause wood to expand and contract, resulting in cracks and warping.
 Loose joints and broken components: Years of use and environmental stress can weaken joints and cause breakage.
 Damaged upholstery and finishes:  Wear and tear, along with exposure to sunlight and dust, can damage upholstery and finishes.</p>
<p>These problems can compromise the structural integrity and aesthetic appeal of your furniture, but thankfully, they are often repairable. The cost of ignoring these issues can quickly escalate, leading to more extensive and costly repairs down the line. Ignoring damage also presents safety concerns â€“ loose joints or unstable structures can pose risks to your family.
