<h2>2. Problem Statement: Common Furniture Issues Facing Non-Profits in Surat</h2>
<p>Many non-profit organizations in Surat face common furniture challenges. The humid climate of Gujarat can lead to wood rot, mildew, and structural weakening of furniture.  Frequent use in high-traffic areas can cause damage to upholstery, frames, and joints.  The cost of replacing damaged furniture can significantly strain already limited budgets.  Furthermore, damaged furniture can pose safety risks, potentially leading to injuries.  Consider the wear and tear on chairs in a busy community center or the damage to desks in a constantly-used classroom.  These issues are not just cosmetic; they impact functionality and safety.
