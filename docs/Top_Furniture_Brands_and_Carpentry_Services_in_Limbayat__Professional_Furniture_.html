<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat: Why You Need Professional Help</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can wreak havoc on your furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  The humidity can cause wood to swell, crack, and rot, affecting its structural integrity.
 Pest infestation:  Warm, humid conditions create a breeding ground for termites and other wood-boring insects.
 Fading and discoloration:  Prolonged sun exposure can cause fabric and wood finishes to fade and lose their vibrancy.
 Structural damage:  Years of wear and tear can lead to loose joints, broken legs, and other structural problems.</p>
<p>Ignoring these issues can lead to costly repairs down the line, and in some cases, complete furniture replacement. Safety is also a concern â€“ damaged furniture can pose a risk to your family.</p>
