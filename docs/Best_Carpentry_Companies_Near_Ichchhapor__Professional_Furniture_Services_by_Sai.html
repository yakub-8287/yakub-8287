<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>

 Pest infestation:  Warm, humid conditions create ideal breeding grounds for termites and other wood-boring insects.
 Fabric fading and deterioration:  Direct sunlight and humidity can cause upholstery to fade and weaken.
 Joint loosening and failure:  Changes in humidity can impact the integrity of joints in furniture, leading to instability.
These problems not only detract from the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but also lead to costly repairs or replacements.</p>
