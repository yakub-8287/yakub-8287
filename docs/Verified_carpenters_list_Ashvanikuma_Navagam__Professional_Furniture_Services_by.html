<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>

The constant temperature fluctuations can also cause paint to peel or fabrics to fade.  These issues can lead to significant expenses and safety concerns if left unaddressed.  Imagine your favorite antique chair becoming structurally unsound or your beloved dining table becoming a breeding ground for pests.  These problems are more common than you think, especially in older homes around the textile market or near the Tapi River.</p>
