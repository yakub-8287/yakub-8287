Damaged furniture not only impacts the aesthetics of your home or office but also poses safety risks, like loose joints and broken legs.  Replacing damaged items can be incredibly expensive, particularly with high-quality, handcrafted pieces.  Ignoring these issues often leads to more extensive (and costly) repairs later on.  The cost of neglecting minor repairs can quickly add up, leading to substantial financial burdens.</p>
