<p>Surat, with its vibrant climate, presents unique challenges for furniture. The high humidity and fluctuating temperatures can cause wood to warp, crack, and become susceptible to pest infestations.  Common issues we see include:</p>
<p>Damaged wooden frames:  Years of use, coupled with the humidity, can weaken joints and damage the structural integrity of chairs, tables, and other furniture.
 Faded finishes:  Sunlight and environmental factors contribute to fading and discoloration of furniture finishes.
 Pest damage:  Termites and other wood-boring insects are a common problem in Surat, requiring professional intervention.
 Loose joints and broken pieces:  Everyday wear and tear can lead to broken components or loose joints, compromising both the look and functionality of your furniture.</p>
