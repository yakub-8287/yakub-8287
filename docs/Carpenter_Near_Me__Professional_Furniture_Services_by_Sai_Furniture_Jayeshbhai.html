<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, can take a toll on your furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  The humidity can cause wood to swell, crack, and rot, especially in older pieces.

   Damaged finishes:  Scratches, stains, and faded finishes detract from the appearance of your furniture.</p>
<p>These issues not only affect the aesthetics of your home but also pose safety risks.  Repairing damaged furniture is often far cheaper than replacing it entirely.</p>
