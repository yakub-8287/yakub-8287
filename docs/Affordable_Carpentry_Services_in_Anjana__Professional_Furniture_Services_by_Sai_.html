<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat &amp; Anjana</h2>

Furthermore, attempting DIY repairs can sometimes lead to further damage or even safety hazards.  </p>
<p>Wood rot and decay: Frequent rainfall and humidity can damage wooden furniture.
   Loose joints and broken components:  Wear and tear over time can weaken furniture.
   Insect infestation: Termites and other insects can cause significant structural damage.</p>
