<h2>2. Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperature, presents unique challenges for wooden furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Cracks and Splits:  Extreme temperature changes cause wood to expand and contract, leading to unsightly cracks and splits.
 Water Damage:  Spills and unexpected moisture can cause significant damage, leading to warping, rotting, and mold.
 Scratches and Dents:  Daily wear and tear inevitably leaves its mark on furniture, diminishing its aesthetic appeal.
 Pest Infestation:  Certain insects can bore into wood, weakening its structure and potentially damaging its integrity.
 Loose Joints and Broken Parts:  Over time, furniture joints can loosen, leading to instability and structural issues.</p>
