<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>

   Loose joints and structural damage:  Years of wear and tear, coupled with environmental factors, often compromise furniture stability.
   Scratches, dents, and water damage:  Accidental damage can significantly reduce your furniture's aesthetic appeal and structural integrity.</p>
