<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>The hot and humid climate of Surat, coupled with dust and potential pest infestations, poses unique challenges to wooden furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Cracks and splits:  Extreme temperature fluctuations can cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks and splits, particularly in older, drier pieces.
 Woodworm damage:  Surat's climate can unfortunately create a breeding ground for woodworms, leading to significant structural damage if left untreated.
 Loose joints and wobbly legs:  Years of use can loosen joints, making your furniture unstable and unsafe.
 Scratches and stains: Daily use inevitably results in scratches and stains, diminishing the aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>These problems not only detract from the beauty of your furniture but also pose safety risks, especially for children and the elderly. Neglecting these issues can also lead to more extensive and costly repairs down the line.</p>
