 Cracked or chipped surfaces:  Extreme temperature fluctuations can cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks and chips.

 Loose joints and broken parts:  Everyday wear and tear can weaken furniture, leading to structural damage.
 Outdated style:  Your existing furniture might not align with your current aesthetic preferences.</p>
