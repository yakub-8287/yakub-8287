<h2>Facing Furniture Problems in Surat?</h2>
<p>The humid climate of Surat and Valsad presents unique challenges for furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  The high humidity can cause wood to absorb moisture, leading to warping, cracking, and even rot.
 Pest infestations:  Warm, humid conditions create a breeding ground for termites and other pests.
 Faded finishes:  The intense Surat sun can cause furniture finishes to fade and deteriorate.
 Outdated designs:  Keeping up with current kitchen trends can be expensive.</p>
