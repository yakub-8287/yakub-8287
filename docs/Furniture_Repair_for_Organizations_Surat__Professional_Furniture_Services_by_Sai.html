<h2>The Challenges of Furniture Maintenance in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate presents unique challenges to furniture.  The fluctuating temperatures and high humidity can lead to:</p>
<p>Wood warping and cracking:  The constant expansion and contraction of wood can cause damage to chairs, desks, and other wooden furniture.
 Fabric deterioration: Moisture can damage upholstery, leading to mold, mildew, and discoloration.<br />
 Metal rust and corrosion:  Exposure to humidity can accelerate the rusting process in metal furniture frames.
 Increased maintenance costs:  Ignoring minor issues can lead to more extensive and expensive repairs down the line.
