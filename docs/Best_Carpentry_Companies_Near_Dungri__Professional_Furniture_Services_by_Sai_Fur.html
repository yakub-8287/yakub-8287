<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat: Why You Need Professional Help</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperatures, can significantly impact your furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood warping and cracking:  Changes in temperature and humidity can cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks and warping.
 Pest infestation:  The warm, humid climate can attract termites and other wood-boring insects, damaging your valuable furniture.
 Upholstery wear and tear:  Regular use and exposure to the elements can cause upholstery to fade, tear, or become uncomfortable.
 Loose joints and broken components:  Over time, furniture can become loose or break down, requiring repair or replacement.</p>
