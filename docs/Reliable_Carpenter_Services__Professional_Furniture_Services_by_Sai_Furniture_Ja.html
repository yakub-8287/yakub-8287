<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat:  The Impact of Climate and Time</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate presents unique challenges to wooden furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood warping and cracking:  Fluctuations in temperature and humidity cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks and warping.
 Pest infestation:  Warm, humid conditions can attract termites and other wood-boring insects, damaging your furniture.
 Fading and discoloration:  Sunlight and exposure to the elements can cause furniture to fade and lose its vibrancy.
 Loose joints and broken parts:  Normal wear and tear, especially with older pieces, can lead to structural instability.</p>
<p>These problems can lead to significant costs, from expensive repairs to complete furniture replacement. Ignoring these issues can also create safety hazards, such as unstable chairs or broken tables.</p>
