<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperatures, presents unique challenges to furniture.  Common problems include:</p>

   Loose joints and broken components:  Years of use and exposure to the elements can loosen joints and break components, rendering your furniture unstable or unusable.
   Pest infestations:  Certain insects are attracted to wood, damaging the structure and appearance of furniture.
   Outdated styles: Your perfectly functional furniture may simply need a refresh to fit the modern design of your home.</p>
