<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperatures, can significantly impact furniture.  Common issues we see include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  High humidity can cause wood to swell and rot, especially in older furniture.
   Cracks and splits:  Extreme temperature changes can lead to cracks and splits in the wood.
   Loose joints and wobbly legs:  Years of use and shifting foundations can loosen joints and make furniture unstable.
   Scratches and dents: Everyday wear and tear often results in surface damage.
   Damaged veneer:  Veneered surfaces are prone to chipping and peeling.</p>
