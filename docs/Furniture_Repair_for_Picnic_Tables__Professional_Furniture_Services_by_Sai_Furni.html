<h2>2. Problem Statement: Common Picnic Table Issues in Surat's Climate</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its high humidity and temperature fluctuations, can take a toll on outdoor furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Rotting wood:  Moisture can cause wood to rot and weaken, leading to structural instability.
   Cracked surfaces:  Extreme temperatures cause expansion and contraction, resulting in cracks and splits.
   Loose joints:  Constant exposure to the elements can loosen screws and joints, making the table wobbly and unsafe.
   Faded paint or stain:  Sunlight can fade the finish, making your picnic table look old and worn.</p>
<p>Ignoring these issues can lead to costly replacements and even pose safety risks.</p>
