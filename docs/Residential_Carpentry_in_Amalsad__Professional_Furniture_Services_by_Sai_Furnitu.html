<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat &amp; Their Solutions</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, can significantly impact the lifespan of your furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood warping and cracking:  The extreme heat and humidity can cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks and warping.
 Pest infestations:  Termites and other wood-boring insects thrive in humid conditions, potentially causing extensive damage.
 Loose joints and broken parts:  Regular use and wear and tear can loosen joints or cause damage to delicate parts.
 Outdated styles and finishes:  Your furniture may no longer complement your home's aesthetic.</p>
