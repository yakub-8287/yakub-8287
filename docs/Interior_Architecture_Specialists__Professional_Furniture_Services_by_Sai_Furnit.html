<p>Surat's climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, presents unique challenges for furniture.  The intense heat can cause wood to warp, while humidity leads to mold and mildew.  These issues not only impact the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but can also compromise its structural integrity and safety.  Ignoring these problems can lead to costly replacements down the line, impacting your budget and disrupting your home's aesthetic harmony.  Many older homes in Surat, particularly those near the Tapi River, experience these effects even more acutely.
