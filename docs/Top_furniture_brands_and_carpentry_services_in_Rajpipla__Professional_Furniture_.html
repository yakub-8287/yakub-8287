<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat &amp; Rajpipla</h2>
<p>Surat, and the surrounding areas like Rajpipla, experience a unique climate characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures. These conditions can significantly impact your furniture's longevity, leading to common problems such as:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  Humidity can cause wood to absorb moisture, leading to warping, cracking, and even rot.
 Pest infestations:  Warm, humid conditions create the perfect breeding ground for termites and other wood-boring insects.
 Fabric fading and discoloration:  Sunlight and humidity can fade upholstery and damage fabric finishes.
 Loose joints and structural damage:  Years of use can weaken joints and cause structural damage to your furniture.</p>
