<h2>Common Furniture Issues in Surat: The Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, presents unique challenges for furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping: The intense humidity can cause wooden furniture to absorb moisture, leading to warping, cracking, and even rot.
 Pest infestations:  Termites and other wood-boring insects thrive in Surat's warm climate, damaging furniture structures.
 Fabric fading and deterioration:  Sunlight and humidity can cause fabric to fade, weaken, and become less durable.
 Metal corrosion:  Exposure to moisture can lead to rust and corrosion in metal furniture components.</p>
<p>These issues not only detract from the aesthetic value of your furniture but also pose safety risks and can lead to costly replacements.</p>
