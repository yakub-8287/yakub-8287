<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's unique climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, poses significant challenges to furniture.  Common issues include:</p>

   Pest infestations:  Termites and other wood-boring insects thrive in humid conditions, causing significant damage to furniture.
   Fabric fading and deterioration:  The strong sunlight can fade upholstery and cause fabrics to weaken over time.
   Loose joints and structural damage:  General wear and tear can cause furniture to become unstable and unsafe.</p>
