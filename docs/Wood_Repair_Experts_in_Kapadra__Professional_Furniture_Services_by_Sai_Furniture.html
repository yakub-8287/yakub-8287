<h2>2. Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can significantly impact the condition of your furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and decay:  Excess moisture weakens wood fibers, leading to rot and structural damage.
   Cracks and splits:  Changes in temperature and humidity can cause wood to expand and contract, resulting in cracks.
   Scratches and dents:  Everyday wear and tear can leave your furniture looking less than perfect.
   Loose joints and instability:  Over time, the joints in your furniture can weaken, leading to instability and potential collapse.
   Pest infestation:  Certain wood-boring insects thrive in humid conditions and can cause extensive damage.</p>
