<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>

 Loose joints and broken components:  Years of use and environmental stress can lead to broken legs, loose joints, and other structural issues.
 Faded finishes and scratches:  Sunlight and regular use can damage the finish of your furniture, leading to unsightly scratches and fading.</p>
