<h2>2. Common Furniture Problems in Surat:  Why You Need a Professional</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures pose significant challenges to your furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  High humidity can cause wood to absorb excess moisture, leading to rotting and warping, especially in older pieces.
   Pest infestations:  Warm temperatures create ideal breeding grounds for wood-boring insects, damaging furniture's structural integrity.
   Cracked and broken joints:  Temperature fluctuations cause wood to expand and contract, weakening joints over time.
   Faded finishes:  Sunlight and humidity can cause furniture finishes to fade and become dull.</p>
<p>Ignoring these issues can lead to expensive repairs down the line, potentially even requiring complete furniture replacement.  Moreover, attempting DIY repairs can lead to further damage and safety hazards.</p>
