<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperatures, can significantly impact wooden furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and decay:  Excess moisture weakens the wood structure, leading to rotting and cracking.
 Cracks and splits:  Changes in temperature cause expansion and contraction, resulting in cracks and splits in the wood.
 Scratches and dents:  Everyday wear and tear can leave your furniture looking less-than-perfect.
 Loose joints and broken components:  Years of use can cause joints to loosen or break completely.
 Pest infestation:  Woodworm and other insects can damage the structure of your furniture, requiring professional treatment.</p>
