<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, poses unique challenges to furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and decay:  Moisture can damage the structural integrity of wooden furniture.
   Cracked or damaged veneers:  Changes in temperature and humidity can cause veneers to separate or crack.
   Insect infestation:  Certain insects thrive in warm, humid conditions and can cause significant damage.
   Loose joints and structural instability:  Years of use can weaken joints, causing instability.
   Damaged upholstery and finishes:  Wear and tear can lead to fading, staining, and deterioration of fabrics and finishes.  This is especially true for traditional Gujarati furniture styles.</p>
<p>Ignoring these problems can lead to irreversible damage and costly repairs down the line.  Furthermore,  damaged furniture can pose safety risks, especially if structural integrity is compromised.</p>
