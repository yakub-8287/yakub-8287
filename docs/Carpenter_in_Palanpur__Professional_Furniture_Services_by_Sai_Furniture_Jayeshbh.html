<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat's Climate</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, can take a toll on your furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood warping and cracking:  The fluctuating humidity levels can cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks and warping.
   Pest infestations:  Warm, humid conditions create an ideal breeding ground for wood-boring insects.
   Finish deterioration:  Humidity can damage the finish of your furniture, leading to peeling and discoloration.
   Loose joints and broken parts:  Normal wear and tear, coupled with environmental factors, can cause furniture to become unstable.</p>
