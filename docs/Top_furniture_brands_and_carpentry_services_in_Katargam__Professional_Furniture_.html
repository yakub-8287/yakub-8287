<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat's Climate</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures pose significant challenges for furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  High humidity can cause wood to absorb excess moisture, leading to rot and warping, especially in older pieces.
 Pest infestation:  Warm and humid conditions create an ideal breeding ground for termites and other wood-boring insects.
 Fabric damage:  Moisture can cause fabric to mildew and fade, impacting the appearance and longevity of upholstered furniture.
 Structural damage:  Extreme temperature fluctuations can cause furniture to crack or weaken over time.</p>
