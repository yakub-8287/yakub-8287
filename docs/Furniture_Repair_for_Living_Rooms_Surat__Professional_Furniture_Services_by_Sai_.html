These problems can lead to unsightly damage, reduced comfort, and potentially unsafe conditions.  Ignoring these issues can lead to costly replacements down the line, adding to your expenses.  For example, a seemingly small crack in a wooden chair leg can eventually lead to structural failure, posing a risk of injury.</p>
