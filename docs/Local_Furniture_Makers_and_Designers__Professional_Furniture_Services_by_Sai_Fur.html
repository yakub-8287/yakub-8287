Frequent monsoon seasons lead to moisture damage, impacting the structural integrity and aesthetic appeal of your furniture.  Poorly made or repaired furniture can pose safety risks, leading to injuries and costly replacements.  Additionally, the cost of replacing damaged furniture can be substantial, making repairs a more economical option.  Many imported pieces simply don't hold up to the Surat environment.</p>
