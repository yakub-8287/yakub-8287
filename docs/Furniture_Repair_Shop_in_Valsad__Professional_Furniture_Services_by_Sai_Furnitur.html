<h2>The Problem: Damaged Furniture in Surat's Climate</h2>
<p>Surat, with its warm and humid climate, presents unique challenges for furniture.  High humidity can lead to warping, cracking, and the growth of mold and mildew, particularly in wooden furniture.  Temperature fluctuations can also cause materials to expand and contract, leading to damage over time.  These issues are not just cosmetic; they can compromise the structural integrity of your furniture, leading to costly replacements.  Furthermore, damaged furniture can pose safety hazards, such as loose joints or sharp splinters. Ignoring these issues can lead to expensive repairs in the long run.</p>
