<h2>2. Problem Statement: Common Dining Furniture Issues in Surat</h2>
<p>The hot and humid Surat climate takes a toll on wooden furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Cracked or warped wood:  Fluctuations in temperature and humidity can cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracks and warping.
   Loose joints and wobbly legs:  Years of use can loosen joints, making tables and chairs unstable and potentially unsafe.
   Scratches and stains: Daily wear and tear, especially with young children, often leads to unsightly damage.
   Damaged upholstery:  Fabrics can fade, tear, or become stained over time, detracting from the overall appearance.</p>
