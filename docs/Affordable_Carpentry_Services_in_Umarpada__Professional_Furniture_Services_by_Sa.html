<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>The hot and humid climate of Surat, Gujarat, presents unique challenges for furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  High humidity can cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracking, warping, and rot, especially in older pieces.
   Pest infestation: Termites and other insects are a significant threat to wooden furniture in the region.
   Loose joints and broken components:  Everyday wear and tear can weaken joints and damage components, making furniture unstable and unsafe.
   Outdated styles:  Many homes in Surat feature traditional furniture styles that may need updating to reflect current design trends.</p>
<p>These issues not only affect the aesthetics of your furniture but also pose safety concerns and can lead to costly replacements.</p>
