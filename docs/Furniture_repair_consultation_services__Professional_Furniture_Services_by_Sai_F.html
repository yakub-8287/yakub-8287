<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat: Addressing the Challenges</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can significantly impact the condition of your furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping: High humidity leads to wood expansion and eventual damage.
   Insect infestation:  Warm temperatures create ideal conditions for wood-boring insects.
   Upholstery wear and tear:  Frequent use and exposure to the elements lead to fabric fading and damage.
   Structural damage:  Accidental damage, improper use, or simply age can compromise the structural integrity of your furniture.</p>
<p>Ignoring these issues not only impacts the aesthetics of your furniture but can also lead to significant costs for complete replacements. Moreover, damaged furniture can pose safety hazards, especially if there's a risk of collapse or sharp splinters.</p>
