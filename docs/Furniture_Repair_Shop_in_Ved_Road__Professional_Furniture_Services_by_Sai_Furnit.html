<h2>2. Common Furniture Problems in Surat:  Why Choose Repair Over Replacement?</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperatures, can take a toll on furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  High humidity can cause wood to absorb moisture, leading to rot and warping.
   Cracked or broken frames:  Temperature fluctuations can cause wood to expand and contract, resulting in cracks and breaks.
   Fabric wear and tear:  Regular use and exposure to sunlight can cause fabric to fade and tear.
   Pest infestation:  Certain insects can damage wood and upholstery.</p>
<p>Ignoring these problems can lead to escalating costs.  A small crack, if left untreated, can lead to structural damage, requiring a more extensive – and expensive – repair.  Furthermore, damaged furniture can pose safety hazards, especially for children.</p>
