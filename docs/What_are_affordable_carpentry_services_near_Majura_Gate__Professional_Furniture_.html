<h2>The Furniture Problems Faced by Surat Residents</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperatures, takes a toll on furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  The intense humidity can cause wood to expand and contract, leading to cracking, warping, and even rot.
   Pest infestation:  Termites and other wood-boring insects are prevalent in the region, causing significant damage.
   Upholstery wear and tear:  Frequent use and exposure to sunlight can fade and damage upholstery.
   Loose joints and broken pieces:  Normal wear and tear can cause furniture to become unstable or break.</p>
<p>These issues not only impact the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but also pose safety hazards and can lead to costly replacements.</p>
