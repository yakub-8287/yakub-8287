<p>Surat's climate, with its fluctuating humidity and temperatures, can take a toll on your furniture.  Wood can warp, joints can loosen, and finishes can crack.  Common issues we encounter include:</p>

   Loose joints:  Humidity can weaken the glue in furniture joints.
   Scratches and dents:  Everyday accidents can leave their mark.
   Faded finishes:  Sunlight and dust can dull the shine.
   Pest infestation:  Certain insects thrive in humid climates and damage wood.</p>
