<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's warm and humid climate presents unique challenges for furniture.  The fluctuating temperatures and high humidity can lead to several issues:</p>
<p>Wood warping and cracking:  Changes in humidity cause wood to expand and contract, leading to warping, cracking, and splitting.
 Pest infestation:  Warm, humid conditions can attract insects like termites and wood borers, causing significant damage.
 Upholstery damage:  Moisture can affect the fabric and foam of upholstery, leading to mold, mildew, and structural damage.
 Loose joints and broken parts:  Years of use can cause joints to loosen and parts to break, especially in older furniture.</p>
