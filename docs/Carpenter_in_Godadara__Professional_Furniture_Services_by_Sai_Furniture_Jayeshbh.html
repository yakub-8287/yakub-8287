<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat: Why You Need a Professional</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, can significantly impact your furniture.  Wood can warp, crack, or become infested with pests.  Ignoring these problems can lead to costly repairs down the line, and attempting DIY fixes can often worsen the situation.  Furthermore, improper handling of tools can lead to safety hazards. Common issues include:</p>
<p>Worn-out joints:  Years of use can loosen joints in chairs, tables, and other furniture pieces.
   Scratches and damage:  Everyday wear and tear inevitably leads to scratches, dents, and other blemishes.
   Pest infestation:  Warm, humid climates create ideal breeding grounds for wood-boring insects.
   Sagging drawers and doors:  These indicate structural issues that require professional attention.</p>
