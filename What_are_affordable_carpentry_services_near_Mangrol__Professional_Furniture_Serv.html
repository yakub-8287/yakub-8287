<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, characterized by high humidity and fluctuating temperatures, can severely impact your furniture.  Common problems include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  Excessive humidity can cause wood to absorb moisture, leading to rot and distortion.
 Cracked and damaged finishes: Temperature fluctuations can cause finishes to crack and peel, diminishing the beauty and longevity of your furniture.
 Pest infestations:  Warm and humid conditions can attract wood-boring insects, damaging furniture structurally.
 Loose joints and broken pieces:  Regular wear and tear, combined with climate effects, weakens furniture structure.</p>
<p>These issues not only affect the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but can also pose safety risks, especially if you have children or pets. Ignoring these problems can lead to costly replacements in the long run.</p>
