<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat &amp; Their Solutions</h2>
<p>Surat, with its vibrant culture and unique climate, presents specific challenges for furniture.  The high humidity and fluctuating temperatures can lead to several common issues:</p>
<p>Wood rot and damage:  Moisture weakens wood, leading to warping, cracking, and even rot.  This is particularly prevalent in older furniture.
 Loose joints and broken pieces:  Years of use and shifting temperatures can cause joints to loosen or break completely.
 Upholstery wear and tear:  Sunlight and regular use can fade colors and damage fabrics on sofas, chairs, and other upholstered furniture.
 Insect infestation:  Certain insects are attracted to wood, causing damage that weakens furniture's structure.</p>
<p>Ignoring these problems can lead to costly replacements down the line. Furthermore, damaged furniture can pose safety hazards, especially for children. Sai Furniture provides affordable solutions to these common issues.</p>
