<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's hot and humid climate presents unique challenges for furniture.  The intense heat and humidity can cause wood to warp, crack, and become susceptible to pest infestation.  Old furniture often requires repairs, and poorly constructed pieces may not withstand the rigors of daily use.  These issues can lead to costly replacements, safety hazards, and an overall decline in the aesthetic appeal of your home.  Let's look at some frequent problems:</p>
<p>Wood rot and decay: High humidity levels can quickly lead to wood rot, especially in poorly maintained furniture.
 Insect infestation: Termites and other wood-boring insects thrive in humid conditions and can significantly damage your furniture.
 Cracked or warped wood: Temperature fluctuations and humidity changes can cause wood to crack, warp, or split.
 Loose joints and broken components: Daily wear and tear can lead to weakened joints and broken parts.</p>
