<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures pose significant challenges to furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  Excess moisture can cause wood to swell, crack, and eventually rot, damaging the structural integrity of your furniture.
   Fading and discoloration:  Prolonged exposure to sunlight can lead to fading and discoloration, especially in fabrics and finishes.
   Pest infestation:  Termites and other wood-boring insects thrive in humid conditions, causing significant damage to wooden furniture.
   Loose joints and broken components:  Everyday wear and tear can loosen joints and break components, compromising the functionality of your furniture.  </p>
