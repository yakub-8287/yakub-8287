<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can take a toll on your furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  High humidity can lead to wood absorbing moisture, causing warping, cracking, and even rot.
   Pest infestation:  Warm temperatures can attract pests like termites and borers, damaging your furniture's structure.
   Fading and discoloration:  Sunlight can cause furniture to fade and lose its vibrancy.
   Loose joints and broken components:  Years of use can lead to wear and tear, making furniture unstable or unsafe.</p>
<p>These problems can not only affect the aesthetics of your home but also lead to costly repairs and safety risks.  Ignoring these issues can result in significant expenses down the line.</p>
