                <h1>Architecture for Retail Spaces | Professional Furniture Services by Sai Furniture (Jayeshbhai)</h1>

<h2>Common Furniture Issues in Surat Retail Spaces</h2>
<p>Surat’s hot and humid climate presents unique challenges for retail furniture.  High humidity can lead to wood rot, warping, and pest infestations, while fluctuating temperatures cause expansion and contraction, damaging furniture structures. This not only impacts aesthetics but also poses safety concerns for customers and staff.  Common issues include damaged chair legs, scratched countertops, and worn-out upholstery.  These issues result in lost revenue through repairs or replacements and can significantly impact the overall appearance and functionality of your retail space. Neglecting these problems can lead to costly replacements down the line.</p>
