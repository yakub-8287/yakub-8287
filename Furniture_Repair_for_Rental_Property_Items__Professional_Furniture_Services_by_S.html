<h2>Common Furniture Problems in Surat Rental Properties</h2>
<p>Surat's humid climate and fluctuating temperatures can significantly impact the lifespan of your rental property furniture.  Common issues include:</p>
<p>Wood rot and warping:  The high humidity can cause wood to absorb moisture, leading to rot, warping, and cracking, particularly in older pieces.
 Pest infestation:  Termites and other pests are a common problem in Surat, damaging furniture frames and upholstery.
 Upholstery wear and tear:  Frequent use and exposure to spills can quickly damage upholstery fabrics.
 Loose joints and broken components:  Daily wear and tear can result in loose joints, broken legs, and other structural issues.
 Scratches and dents:  Moving furniture or accidental damage can leave unsightly marks on your rental propertyâ€™s furniture.</p>
<p>These problems not only impact the aesthetic appeal of your property but also carry safety concerns and can lead to costly replacements.</p>
