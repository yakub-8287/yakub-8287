Frequent use further exacerbates these issues, leading to broken chairs, scratched tables, and damaged upholstery.  Ignoring these problems not only detracts from your restaurant's aesthetic appeal but also poses safety risks for your patrons and incurs costly replacements down the line.  Furthermore, finding reliable and specialized furniture repair services locally can be a challenge.</p>
