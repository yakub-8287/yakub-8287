<h2>2. Problem Statement: The Challenges Facing Outdoor Furniture in Surat</h2>
<p>Surat's climate, with its intense heat and humidity, takes a toll on outdoor furniture.  The sun's harsh rays can fade colours and dry out wood, leading to cracking and splitting.  Monsoon season brings its own set of problems: moisture damage, rot, and the growth of mildew. This damage not only affects the aesthetic appeal of your furniture but also compromises its structural integrity, potentially leading to accidents. Ignoring these problems can lead to costly replacements down the line.  Furthermore, attempting DIY repairs can sometimes worsen the damage or even lead to injury.</p>
